HUNT DATA DIRECTORY

There is some directory structure in here
where puzzles and solutions and rounds have to go.

There is a teams.txt file which is a tab-separated table of team info
There is a team_phones.txt file which is a tab-separated table of team phone numbers

the htpasswd directory needs to be created in here with privileges
to the webserver user so that spoilr can create the auth data for teams/users

This should be checked out in /home/hunt for use by spoilr
