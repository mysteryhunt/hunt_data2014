<i>"When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, "it means just 
what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less."</i>
</p><p>
It's time for Professor Dumpty's vocabulary exam, and you may need to do
some last-minute studying. Review the Professor's list of vocabulary words
and definitions below; they may differ from the meanings you are familiar
with, but you're being tested on Professor Dumpty's definitions, not yours.
</p><p>
When you're ready, call HQ to make an exam
appointment for one member of your team. You will be given a series of definitions, 
and you will be asked to respond with the corresponding vocabulary words, without the use of
any notes or references. If you give too 
many incorrect answers, you will need to study harder, make another appointment, 
and try again.
