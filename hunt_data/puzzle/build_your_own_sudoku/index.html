<h3>Sectors</h3>
<table class="info">
<tr><th>Northwest<td>No square with a given number in the Northwest Sector touches another square with a given number in the same sector along an edge. (In general we say a square touches another if it is the same square or it shares an edge or corner.)
<tr><th>North<td>The sum of the given numbers in the North Sector is 13.
<tr><th>Northeast<td>There is a continuous path of touching squares with given numbers from the upper-right corner of the sudoku grid to the lower-left corner of the sudoku grid.
<tr><th>West<td>The sum of the given numbers in the West Sector is 27, while their product is 1512.
<tr><th>Center<td>Rotational symmetry: if there is a given number in any square of the sudoku grid, there is also a (possibly different) given number in the square 180&deg; opposite.
<tr><th>East<td>The product of the given numbers in the East Sector is 288.
<tr><th>Southwest<td>Square I1 matches its antipodal square (A9) in the unsolved grid.
<tr><th>South<td>The sum of the given numbers in the South Sector is 16.
<tr><th>Southeast<td>The given numbers in the Southeast Sector are exactly those in the East Sector.

<h3>Rows</h3>
<table class="info">
<tr><th>A<td>The third square of Row A (A3) matches its antipodal square (I7) in the unsolved grid.
<tr><th>B<td>The given numbers in Row B are exactly those in Column 6.
<tr><th>C<td>The leftmost given number in Row C divides all the other given numbers in its sector.
<tr><th>D<td>The product of the given numbers in D8 and D9 is 16.
<tr><th>E<td>None of the squares with given numbers in Row E are directly above any of the four squares with given numbers in the row below, or directly below any of the squares with given numbers in the row above.
<tr><th>F<td>The sum of the given numbers in Row F, which is the same as the sum of the given numbers in Row D, is 20.
<tr><th>G<td>Row G, and every other row, has at least three given numbers.
<tr><th>H<td>The product of the given numbers in H3 and H4 is 72.
<tr><th>I<td>The sum of any given numbers in I1, I2, I3, and I4 is 6 more than the sum of any given numbers in H1 and H2, but 3 less than the sum of any given numbers in Column 5.

<h3>Columns</h3>
<table class="info">
<tr><th>1<td>The product of any given numbers in D1, E1, F1, and G1 is 63.
<tr><th>2<td>The product of the given numbers in Column 2 is 18 more than the product of any given numbers in the Northeast Sector.
<tr><th>3<td>The sum of the given numbers in Column 3 is 17.
<tr><th>4<td>The three squares with given numbers in Column 4 are touching.
<tr><th>5<td>There is only one given number in Column 5.
<tr><th>6<td>There is only one square with a given number touching G6.
<tr><th>7<td>None of the four squares with given numbers in Column 7 touch each other.
<tr><th>8<td>There are the same number of squares with given numbers touching A8 as there are touching B8.
<tr><th>9<td>The product of the given numbers in Column 9 is 180.
