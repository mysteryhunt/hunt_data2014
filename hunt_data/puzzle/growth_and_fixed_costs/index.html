<p> <i>The financial statements of two Wonderland banks and all their
customers were set aside for tax irregularities... something here
doesn't add up.</i> </p>

<p><b><a href="statement.pdf">Statement of Operations</a></b></p>

<p><b>1. Standard Bank of Wonderland</b><br />
A commercial bank offering loans with competitive interest rates to
Wonderland businesses; it has also issued a consumer credit
card. Walrus is a major shareholder.</p>

<p><b>2. First Wonderland Bank</b><br />
A bank focused on small Wonderland merchants and loans for Wonderland
individuals. First Wonderland has many branches in convenient areas of
Wonderland and excellent customer service. </p>

<p><b>3. Rust Works Steel & Metal Products</b><br />
Rust Works Steel & Metal Products is an industrial conglomerate that
mines raw materials and makes steel and other industrial goods in a
highly-automated operation. It sells to Travels with Turtles as well
as to Solid Manufacturing, Inc. The mines it owns are expected to be
in operation for close to a century; other fixed assets are also
long-lived, but are occasionally sold.  Rust Works Steel & Metal
Products is slow to pay its bills and slow to collect payment from its
customers. Similarly, its customers have high "days payable" and "days
receivable" amounts. </p>

<p><b>4. Travels with Turtles</b><br />
A popular, well-known travel company that owns its own infrastructure
and cars, each of which require replacement every couple of
decades. Travels with Turtles is financed with a loan from Standard
Bank of Wonderland; some years it loses money. </p>

<p><b>5. Wonderland Dyes and Potions</b><br />
This innovative company is the premier producer of dyes and flavors in
Wonderland: Its ingredients are key for manufacture of blacking and
whiting as well as toothpaste and any size-changing food or
drink. Wonderland D&P owns top-of-the-line chemical manufacturing
equipment. It is known to demand quick payment from its customers, and
this reputation helps its customers keep their accounts recievable
balances low as well. </p>

<p><b>6. Solid Manufacturing, Inc.</b><br />
This contract manufacturer for Dovetail Design also makes tooling for
White Rabbit Timepieces and other customers. It is heavily invested
in precision manufacturing equipment and its margins are razor-thin. </p>

<p><b>7. Dovetail Design & Manufacturing</b><br />
Leading provider of computational plug-ins for mechanical "computers"
which are increasingly popular in Wonderland. Dovetail offers modules
that perform simple differentiation and integration that can be
connected into simple parlour games; it continuously develops new
products.</p>

<p>Dovetail contracts with Solid Manufacturing, Inc. for the
high-precision manufacturing of its widgets. Its name is known
throughout Wonderland, and its products are sold in a variety of
Wonderland shops and resellers. Carpenter owns a majority stake and
refuses to bank with Standard Wonderland.  </p>

<p><b>8. Emblaze</b><br />
The Cheshire Cat's line of toothpaste. The majority of ingredients are
purchased from Wonderland Dyes and Potions; its materials are cheap
but its advertising is expensive, as is its manufacturing equipment
which must be replaced about every ten years. Like most customers of
Wonderland Dyes and Potions, Emblaze is paid promptly and pays its
bills promptly as well.</p>

<p><b>9. The White and The Black</b><br />
One of many manufacturers of blacking and whiting, this small company
is dependent on the only supplier for its key ingredients, Wonderland
Dyes and Potions. Owned by Gryphon, who prides himself on managing
cash flow and keeping inventory days low.</p>

<p><b>10. White Rabbit Timepieces</b><br />
This independent watch manufacturer has a strong brand and strives to
reach exclusive Wonderland customers. Many Wonderland shops carry one
or two types of Rabbit watches; in contrast, the company store carries
each of hundreds of models and sizes. Distribution shops pay Rabbit
only after a watch has sold.</p>

<p>The manufacturing is done by hand using specialized equipment that
typically lasts about 15 years.</p>

<p><b>11. Caterpillar Smoke and Gears</b><br />
Large chain of customer shops owned by Caterpillar; these stores are
the only source in Wonderland for some consumer goods such as
Gryphon's Blacking and Whiting. In the last few years Caterpillar has
acquired two smaller chains of customer shops to move into higher
foot-traffic locations; before the acquisitions Caterpillar Smoke and
Gears had several money-losing years.</p>

<p>Caterpillar Smoke and Gears lost a trademark battle last year to
White's Chess Supply and Sundries, and is financed via loans from
Standard Bank of Wonderland.</p>

<p><b>12. White's Chess Supply and Sundries</b><br />
Chain of consumer shops, owned by the court of the White King, that
deals in many kinds of consumer goods and funds upkeep of the King's
court. Staff's activities include development of new chess pieces and
use of new materials in boards and pieces.</p>

<p><b>13. Scrumptious Essences</b><br />
This chain of shops has an exclusive license to sell size-changing
Drinkme&trade; and Eatme&trade; products, which it makes using materials
purchased from Wonderland Dye. Scrumptious Essences also does some
experimenting on potions' effect on mirrors.</p>

<p><b>14. Tweedle Brothers Essential Supplies</b><br />
This small customer shop, like many in Wonderland, sells looking
glasses, toothpaste, and magic potions. The brothers own their
building and staff the counter themselves whenever possible. The shop
only keeps the most commonly needed items and is often
out-of-stock. Tweedle Brothers is slow to pay its bills.</p>

<p><b>15. Hatter's Tea-stop</b><br />
Tea shop owned by the Mad Hatter, who spends some of his time
developing new tea combinations. Offers customers who are having an
unbirthday the unusual option to pay after 30 days, but then often has
trouble collecting payment.  </p>

<p><b>16. Little Mouse Tea</b><br />
Tea shop formerly part of Hatter's Tea-stop that split off a few
years ago and subsequently lost a suit filed by the same. Benefited
from low prices for raw tea across Wonderland this year. The corporate
split was funded by a loan which will come due in a few years.

<p><b>17. Humpty Dumpty Sundries</b><br />
Another sundries shop, one of the best-respected names among sundry
shops in Wonderland. Offers guaranteed availability of the widest
range of goods anywhere in Wonderland; suppliers grumble about Humpty
Dumpty's fairly long days payable.</p>

<p><b>18. The Purple Walrus</b><br />
This oyster bar owned by Walrus is not very popular and not very
unpopular. Staff are known to be grumpy, but the oysters are always
fresh. The bar has borrowed heavily from Standard Bank of Wonderland,
the smallest business to do so, and has good relationships with
vendors of lemon juice and wine.</p>

<p>For years, the tax agency has puzzled over the Purple Walrus's low
costs and low profitability; they wonder where the revenues are
going.</p>

<p><b>19. Wonderland Pie Holdings</b><br />
This company owns several restaurant brands in Wonderland. It
advertises heavily for all its brands, but since many locations are
out-of-the-way and staff tends to be grumpy, the restaurants are
generally not that popular&mdash;though management claims they are. It is
owned by the Red Queen, who receives some cash from it every year. She
takes pride in the fact that Wonderland Pie is bigger than other
restauranteurs (but they have noticed that she still pays her vendors
a lot for ingredients).</p>

<p><b>20. Right Raven Pub</b><br />
A small pub owned by a group of the Red Queen's guards that operates
out of a house in the court and receives food and beer deliveries
daily. The guards are happy waiters and bartenders, even though they
expect the Queen to take any of the pub's profits.  Right Raven is
financed via a large loan from First Wonderland that they expect to
roll over when it comes due in several years.</p>
