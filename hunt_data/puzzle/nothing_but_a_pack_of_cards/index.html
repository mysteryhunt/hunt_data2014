"I thought a good way to pass the time might be building a house of cards, but I can't seem to find any cards," sighed the Mock Turtle. "You'd think they'd be easy to find in Wonderland!"
</div>

<br/>

<p>The Mock Turtle needs your help in finding cards for his card house ... and then building it, too (turtles lack the opposable thumbs necessary for proper card placement).

<p>You must build a card house of the following height: [insert height requirements dependent on team size that we haven't figured out yet]

<p>There are 104 cards available. In order to obtain these cards, you must bring us the matching item as listed below. For every item you bring that successfully matches an item listed, we will give you the matching card. This is the only way cards can be obtained. Do not bring your own cards for use in the card house.

<p>As a bonus, for any four-of-a-kinds or royal flushes obtained from the same deck, you will receive a bonus joker. Jokers act as wild cards and can be placed anywhere in your card house.

<p>Cards may only be placed in the card house above other cards with greater or equal value (aces are high). You may not bend the cards in your card house. Your card house must stand for 30 seconds with no external support.

<p>Once you think you've acquired the necessary materials to build an acceptable card house, please call HQ.
