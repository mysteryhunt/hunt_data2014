Oh no! There used to be a puzzle here, but just a moment ago, a storm passed through and swept all of the pieces away! Oh where can they all be?
</div>

<br/>

<ul>
<li>One piece is fleeing from a bunch of villains wearing monster costumes.</li>
<li>One piece is futilely trying to hide behind a stack of transparencies.</li>
<li>One piece is having fun learning how to buzz buzz buzz buzz in harmony.</li>
<li>One piece is irresistibly attracted to a certain handsome towel-clad gentleman.</li>
<li>One piece is showing off after being folded into a beautiful flower.</li>
<li>One piece is simply mesmerized by the performance of a blue organist.</li>
</ul>
