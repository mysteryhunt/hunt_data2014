    <h3> Correspondences </h3>
    <p>Below are 12 sets of correspondences received by the White Knight, who is playing Austria in this game.  Each set relates to a map position immediately prior to the Spring or Fall moves.  Unfortunately, due to bureaucratic ineptitude, the dates of all sets of correspondence have been lost.</p>
    <hr />
    
    <p>Dear White Knight, British troops are enjoying the beautiful weather on the island.  I think we'll stay at home this move.  -Alfred of Britain</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, I hear your concern about the evil British.  French troops will enter the channel to challenge them.  -Bastien of France</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, I agree it's best if you, me and Germany all stay out of Tyrolia.  We will not move there on this move.  -Carla of Italy</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, We understand the importance of Galicia to Austria's security, and Russian troops will not enter that province.  -Dmitry of Russia</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, Thank you for informing us of Russia's plans to enter the black sea.  We will challenge them there.  -Ela of Turkey</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, I agree it's best if you, me and Italy all stay out of Tyrolia.  We will not move there on this move.  -Franziska of Germany</p>
    <hr />
    
    <p>Dear White Knight, Turkish armies will not be allowed to use British vessels.  -Alfred of Britain</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, Our army in Marseilles will move into Burgundy.  -Bastien of France</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, If you leave the Adriatic Sea, we will not move into Trieste.  -Carla of Italy</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight,  We will be occupying Ankara, since the Turks left it wide open for us.  -Dmitry of Russia</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, Your intelligence is clearly faulty. How could we possibly be coordinating with the British? Our focus remains on the Russians, and we will not be using any support or transport from the British. Ridiculous!  -Ela of Turkey</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, We will not be supporting Turkish troops. How could such a thing even be accomplished?  -Franziska of Germany</p>
    <hr />
    
    <p>Dear White Knight, We want no part in the war, all our fleets currently deployed will return to home ports.  -Alfred of Britain</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, The British move into Brest in the last move, Fall '01, forced our army to remain in Picardy, however this spring we will support the Germans against a British attack in Belgium.  -Bastien of France</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, Our movement into Tyrolia was purely defensive.  As a sign of our peaceful intentions towards Austria, this turn we will move Tyrolia to Piedmont.  -Carla of Italy</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, We will move out of Galicia to the colder, more hospitable climes of the Ukraine.  -Dmitry of Russia</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, The Russians have gone too far in their movements and trickery!  We will support you into Galicia from Rumania.  -Ela of Turkey</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, We agree that Russian menace must be stopped. Our troops will support you into Galicia from Bohemia.  -Franziska of Germany</p>
    <hr />
    
    <p>Dear White Knight, We want no part in the war, all our fleets will return to their home ports.  -Alfred of Britain</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, We will move into Brest to protect against the British menace. -Bastien of France</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, Against our better instincts, and the recent betrayal on your part, we will trust you this turn and not move into Tyrolia. -Carla of Italy</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, We will not meddle in the Balkans. We'll be moving north from Warsaw into Prussia to counter the German threat. -Dmitry of Russia</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, Russia's recent incursions are a threat to us both. With your support we can take Rumania to wall out the Russians. In return, we will not contest an Austrian presence in Greece. -Ela of Turkey</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, Your attempt to take Tyrolia is troubling, but so are the Russian's deployments. Our Silesian troops are forced to hold on this turn. -Franziska of Germany</p>
    <hr />      
    
    <p>Dear White Knight, We want no part in the war, we will convoy our army out of Germany.  -Alfred of Britain</p>

    <p>Dear White Knight, We promise that we will retreat our army into Tyrolia and support it twice.  -Carla of Italy</p>

    <p>Dear White Knight, We promise we are now focused on the Russians entirely and will not move any further west than we already have done.  -Ela of Turkey</p>

    <p>Dear White Knight, We will move our army from Tyrolia to Piedmont.  -Carla of Italy</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, We will pull forces back to prevent a Turkish invasion of Moscow. We will not support the British in Galicia at all, and we will try to maintain a troop presence in Warsaw and Silesia to preclude the possibility the British can retreat there.  -Dmitry of Russia</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, We'll hold the Ukraine to block the British retreat and will make no attempt to take advantage of the situation by invading Serbia.  -Ela of Turkey</p>

    <p>Dear White Knight, Having served their purpose, our troops in Tyrolia are now needed elsewhere and will move back to Munich.  -Franziska of Germany</p>

    <p>Dear White Knight, As promised previously, Greece will be allowed to remain yours. Our fleet in the Ionian will be holding to prevent retaliation from the Italians.  -Ela of Turkey</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, We will not be marching our armies anywhere, least of all to Tyrolia.  -Franziska of Germany</p>
    <hr />
    
    <p>Dear White Knight, We want no part in the war, we will retreat our forces, both in Scandinavia and the mainland.  -Alfred of Britain</p>
    <p>Dear White Knight, Britain's ambitions scare us, we will support the German recapture of Belgium.  -Bastien of France</p>

    <p>Dear White Knight, Clearly your allegiances are formidable, our support of Galicia from Warsaw was not enough in the spring. Our troops from Warsaw will hold there to protect our supplies from the likes of you.  -Dmitry of Russia</p>

    <p>Dear White Knight, The British are our greatest concern at the moment, and our fleet in Holland was unable to take Belgium in the previous move. Troops from Silesia and Bohemia will need to pull back into Berlin and Munich.  -Franziska of Germany</p>
    <hr />
    
    <p>Dear White Knight, We will retreat all of our fleets towards the British isles.  -Alfred of Britain</p>
