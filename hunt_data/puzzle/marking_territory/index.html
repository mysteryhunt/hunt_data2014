<i>The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown.<br>
The Lion beat the Unicorn all around the town.<br>
The Lion stretched to fill his kingdom, savoring the space.<br>
The Unicorn pranced 'round the edge with mythologic grace.<br>
The animals observed the clash with eager apprehension.<br>
A brawl occurred, then off they went for medical attention.<br>
Each day at dawn, they met again to play this violent game.<br>
The field of battle changed each time, yet some things stayed the same.</i>

Each of the three grids below represents a battle between the Lion and the Unicorn. In each grid, 
the territories follow these rules:
<ul>
<li>The entire field is divided into rectangular territories, with edges along the gridlines. 
No territory overlaps another territory, 
and every square in the field is part of a territory. Every territory belongs to either
the Lion or the Unicorn.</li>
<li>Each Lion's territory contains exactly one square with a number; this number is the <i>area</i> of the 
territory.</li>
<li>Each Unicorn's territory contains exactly one square with a number; this number is the <i>perimeter</i> of the 
territory.</li>
<li>No three territories belonging to the same combatant meet at a single point.</li>
</ul>
