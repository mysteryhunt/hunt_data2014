<p><strong>Host:</strong> Welcome to opening day at Top Shelf. We don't open for another few minutes, but feel free to grab yourself a seat at the bar while I get set up. You can see I haven't even had a chance to stock our two shelves.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Thanks. It's good to finally have a nice bar in this neighborhood.</p> 

<p><strong>Host:</strong> We're happy to be here. If you're interested, I've personally curated this collection and can tell you all about it while you wait. </p>

<p>For instance, this bourbon comes only from barrels aged at the center section of warehouse 'H'.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Hmm.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Did you know that these two are made by a company named after a mixed drink that included absinthe? They're both part of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Nope.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> I see the younger version of this in liquor stores all the time, but this version is part of the Antique Collection, and is much harder to find</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Gotcha.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Don't judge a whiskey by its color. This stuff isn't fancy, but it's aged at least four years.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Hah!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> The funny thing about this Kentucky bourbon is that it's shipped over to Germany for bottling.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Really?</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> And this one &mdash; after a century-long hiatus, this family returned to making whiskey using the original recipes.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Wow.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> This bourbon was reportedly a favorite of Ulysses S Grant. It seems the quality has deteriorated somewhat since his day.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Right.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> For a long time the distiller behind this bottle was known to produce a lot of rot gut whiskey. It's really turned itself around. I think being purchased by a company from the Far East helped.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Very interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Would you believe me if I told you that a limited number of bottles of this vintage of Willett actually came from the Stitzel Weller mashbill?</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> I would.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> I actually had a chance to visit the Kentucky land that this whiskey was named after. It's a beautiful spot along a river.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Sounds lovely. </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> This one's so popular even billionaires can't find an unopened bottle of it to buy.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> No kidding. </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> This one is only semi related to the superior 'A.H.' variety.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Hmm, okay.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Some people think this is Pappy, but it's really just a Van Winkle.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Didn't realize that.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> This is another from the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection. It ages for no less than 15 years.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> That's pretty old.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> They release this once a year to celebrate an event in early September.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Every year, really?</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> I personally prefer the rye of the same name and age from this distiller.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> The rye's good.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> The previous year's release of this bourbon is still one of my favorites &mdash; finished off in cognac casks.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Cognac casks, eh?</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> I was pretty surprised when I learned that this one here was Harry Truman's favorite bourbon, given the type of clientele who want to drink it.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Truman can't be wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> I had to stock this when I read the reviews: "It tastes like the sweat of a hobo who got drunk on bourbon."</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Doubt I'll try that.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Not one of my favorites, but named after a Kentucky recluse.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> That one looks good, too.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> They also make honey, cherry and cinnamon versions of this guy, but I think it's terrible to do that to a bourbon. I stick with this label.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Yeah, bourbons shouldn't be flavored.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> This 80-proof bourbon was a good brand before the current company bought the name.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Why do new owners ruin things?</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Rumor has it that a groove metal band from the early eighties named an album after this bourbon.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> I think I know that album.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Would you believe that this bourbon is made by the only remaining family-owned distillery in Kentucky? You'd think after all these years they'd know how to make better bourbon than this.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Nothing like alcohol to forge friendship.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> This one is good, but I actually prefer the younger 18-year-old variety.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> I hear they're both quite difficult to find.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> If you're familiar with the Velvet Glove, this is very similar, just a year older.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Yeah, that's similar to the iron fist, am I right?</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> You could say that this is as rare as it gets. Only an act of God could produce something like this.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger I suppose.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> This wheated bourbon is the fifth and final bottle in the Antique Collection.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> I might need to order the whole flight of that collection.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> This one is referenced on the t-shirts of a floor in the East Campus dormitory at MIT.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Ah yes, I got a late night tour from him once.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Rumor has it, the rye in this bottle is much older than the label indicates. The age listed on the bottle refers to the youngest of the whiskies inside.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> How misleading &mdash; though I suppose it makes the bottle more valuable, right?</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> The name of this bourbon supposedly comes from a poker hand, in reference to a type of straight. I wouldn't bet on it if you're trying to impress a date, however.</p>

<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Thanks for the tip. I wouldn't want to seem like a cheapskate.</p>
