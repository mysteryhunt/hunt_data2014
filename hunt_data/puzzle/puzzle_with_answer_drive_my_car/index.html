<p>All of my other pickaxes had been made of wood, but I used this new diamond one as a pool cue and finally beat Roman in a game of 8-ball.</p>
<p>No longer sure what was real and what was a just drug-fueled delusion, I threw a brick and killed two of my enemies, then grew floppy ears and a trunk and shot a hamster.</p>
<p>So I defeated Ahriman after the 99th time Elika prevented my death, but all I got for it was this Gold Sunflower Trophy.</p>
<p>Well, there I was on Tenacity running left to right as usual and a gigantic fish jumped right in my path, but when I altered my memories and did it all over again I moved the cup holder, opened the hand bag, and turned on Jax to avoid the accident.</p>
<p>Even shooting ten guardians from the front while their shields were raised wasn't enough to make up for my minister's gaffe, so I had no choice but to fire him.</p>
<p>Really, the 50,000 orcs I killed were just a warmup for my 10 ranked deathmatch wins against Xenomorphs and dreadlock-sporting extraterrestrials.</p>
<p>Difficult as it was to beat the campaign on 1999 mode, casually defeating the Nether King with no second chances was even harder.</p>
<p>Really stacking my gear with pickup radius buffs was key to making my first 5 million, but I couldn't have done it without sending my Sackboy outside my own creations to complete something created by the community.</p>
<p>I must have destroyed 21 exploding barrels while searching for the Hekaton, and I just found my eleventh relic on the way back to the Endurance.</p>
<p>Vegas's slots had a funny effect on me: after ten spins, I decided to just submit to fate and not shoot Konrad.</p>
<p>Every lifestone was mine, so I used fire reinforcement until I had the best weapon possible.</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell's overseer threw a live grenade at me and I took him out by throwing it right back, but afterwards I chickened out and went back to the creepy castle, where I rescued my 200th unborn sibling.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was chasing down Hugo Moller through the streets of Los Angeles, and now here I am in the middle of a normal difficulty volcano standing over the dead body of Albert Wesker.</p>
<p>Clearing all of the ghosts out of the well using Electro Bolts sure did make me dizzy, but it was nothing compared to spinning my way through Hexagoner.</p>
<p>After winning a van in Austin, Texas during my band's world tour, I filled it up by spawning 2,000 G-Man ragdolls.</p>
<p>Rolling across Pandora in my outrunner, I rammed 25 enemies on my way to the the Imperial City, where I met up with Owyn the Blademaster and joined his faction.</p>
