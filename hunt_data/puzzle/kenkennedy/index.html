<h3>SUMMERS</h3>
<p>
<ul>

<li><b>A:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may have been off making mummy movies when the Alliance was formed, but we've invaded and we're not going anywhere. 
And neither is this big gold belt, which means a hell of a lot more than your
company's title, now can you dig that?! I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>B:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may have called me a glorified
stuntman in your book, but I'm going to turn you into a glorified quitter,
because the only way I'd ever give up is if you did a whole lot of damage
to me, or if you threatened somebody I care about! I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>C:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may think it's cute to dance to 
imitation hip-hop music while backed up by your much smaller, much whiter
partners, but this is just another perversion that my partners and I need
to keep off television! I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>D:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may have scared the heck out of me
by giving me a fake reptile for my birthday, but this time I'll be bringing
a cage full of rodents, and there's nothing that police officer referee can
do to stop me! I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>E:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may be the newly crowned King of the
Ring, and you may have crushed a legend with a bearhug, but the one thing
you have yet to do is to go one... on one... with the great one! It doesn't
matter if you think you can be the youngest champion of all time! I will
see you in the ring!

<li><b>F:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may have won the World Heavyweight
Championship from me last month, but provoking me into kicking you below the
belt and getting disqualified is a super-lame way to win a title, and this
time it'll be no holds barred! I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>G:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may have managed to maintain control
of the blue brand by being engaged to the General Manager, but once she found
out you were cheating on her with the wedding planner, she brought me back to
take care of business in a locked steel cell! I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>H:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may think victories are all about 
pinfalls and submissions, but I'm gonna prove I'm better than you by getting
out of a boiler room and grabbing a container from a pasty guy named Paul! Or should I say, Uncle Paul? I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>I:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. We may have teamed up to beat two Arab
Americans on pay-per-view, and then a "cool" guy and an Olympian on TV,
but when you superkicked me with no warning, this changed from a partnership
to a first-time dream match! I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>J:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may have shown up in the middle
of my GM-appointed mandatory psychological evaluation claiming to be my 
anger management therapist, but I'm reasonably sure that licensed therapists
don't slam your face into a wall! I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>K:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. My partner may have been reduced to 
grilling hamburgers for ungrateful children, but back in the day, we were
one of the most controversial tag teams of the Attitude Era. And now we're going to show you two twerps that your real "legacy" is losing to us! I
will see you in the ring!

<li><b>L:</b> Let me tell you something, brother... er, sister. I may have spent years
mistreating you and caused the MegaPowers to implode due to my jealousy, but
deep down, I love you, and I think it's time we got married in front of 
thousands of fans! I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>M:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may have showed up out of nowhere
and cost me my shot at the Royal Rumble, and then suffocated me with 
chloroform in Las Vegas, at Caesars Palace, but I'm tired of your stupid
hairy costume, and it's time for you to rest in peace! I will see you in 
the ring!

<li><b>N:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may think it's distasteful to
have a match where my pregnant girlfriend marries the winner, even if that winner turns out to be a creepy hairless demon who can control fire, but...
Actually, I have no real argument here. I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>O:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may be celebrating your European
Championship by claiming to come from a different city every night, but
my experience in the adult film industry will surely give me the edge, 
loaded chest protector or not. I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>P:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may have previously been a member of
Demolition and then a proud native of Hawaii, but now you're in charge of a
motorcycle gang, and it's not as tough as my gang of Puerto Ricans, who are
going to destroy your guys in this tag match! I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>Q:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. My dad may run this company, and you may
have run the company that beat us in the ratings before we put you out of
business, but when you make suggestive comments about my mother, that's when
it's no longer time for business and instead time for violence! I will see
you in the ring!

<li><b>R:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may claim you haven't sold out and joined Ted DiBiase's Corporation, but I know the truth. And the truth 
certainly isn't that I'm the one who sold out and am planning to stuff money
in your mouth after our match, because that would be cruel and ironic! I will
see you in the ring!

<li><b>S:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may have forced my crowned friend to
kiss your feet earlier this year, but I deal in a different type of crowns,
being an evil dentist. And you won't get any novocaine for the pain I'm going
to bring to you! I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>T:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may want my Hardcore championship,
but I promise you that if you win, I will steal your chihuahua, kill him, and
trick you into eating him! And now that I say that out loud, it sounds like a
bit of an overreaction. But I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>U:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may have had your eyes on my valet
for a few weeks, and I may want to clean your clock, but you're pretty and
I'm pretty, so we're going to do it without hitting each other in the face!
I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>V:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may have beaten me, your former
tag team partner, to win a title shot in a briefcase, but I bet it wasn't
cheap to get a brand new briefcase after I chucked the old one into the
Gulf of Mexico! I will see you in the ring! 

<li><b>W:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. I may be a fictional wrestler who was
introduced in a movie eight years before I was in <i>The Fifth Element</i>,
but me and the Macho Man have come here to fight you for real! I will see
you in the ring!

<li><b>X:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may have attacked my knee during our
I Quit match and put me out of action for almost a year, but in my return, 
I'm going to prove you're not even half the competitor your cousin Eddie was!
I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>Y:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You may think you're facing some guy who
carries around scissors, but if he doesn't show up and you make the mistake
of making an open challenge, I will beat you in under a minute and take your
title! I will see you in the ring!

<li><b>Z:</b> Let me tell you something, brother. You and your minor-league reality show
contestants may have torn apart a ring on live TV, but for this elimination match, I've got a seventh team member you're not expecting, and no matter
what he might think, it's not the Miz. I will see you in the ring!
