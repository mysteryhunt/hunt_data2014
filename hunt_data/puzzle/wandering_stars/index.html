<blockquote><b>You mortals constantly attribute your greatest achievements of exploration to the influence of the divine.  But do you ever wonder why we choose to intervene?  Did you ever consider that we are sending you a message?  Take, for example, the moment when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planted that American flag on the moon.  You might have seen the clear influence of both the god of love and the god of war in that moment, but I am sure you did not comprehend the message they were sending you all the way from where they reside.  Let me aid you, mortal; it was simply "B."  Now tell me, what do these events really mean?</b>
