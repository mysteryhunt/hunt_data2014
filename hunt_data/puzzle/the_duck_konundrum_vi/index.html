<div class="mh-flavortext">
There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!" Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.
</div>
<br/>
<p>
The Duckchess is an incredibly picky eater, and it takes five quasicelebrity chefs to 
prepare her daily meals. The five chefs listed below each begin seated around a round table
at equal intervals, counterclockwise in alphabetical order by first name (Dude, Emerald, Jordan,
Milton, Pauletta). In front of each chef is a cutting board. Also on the table is a large lazy
Susan with ten equally spaced pots on it, so that there is one pot in front of each chef, and
also one pot between each pair of adjacent chefs' pots. The lazy Susan, like all 
self-respecting lazy Susans, can rotate, so these pots may move during the cooking 
process. The lazy Susan has ten positions, so a one-position rotation moves all of
the pots that were in front of chefs to be between chefs.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of each phase, each chef should count the total number of tablespoons of
pepper in the pot directly in front of them. 
Based on that number, they should each choose the appropriate action from 
their list of actions. These actions each have names (the cooking-related verbs
in capital letters), and the order in which the five chefs perform these 
five actions should be alphabetically by action name. 
The amount of pepper in the pots may then change as other chefs follow 
their instructions, but the subsequent chefs should
not change actions or order; the choice and order of actions is determined at the
beginning of the phase only. (There is one exception to this rule: if an action says
that a chef shuts down the kitchen, all chefs stop cooking immediately at the end of 
that chef's action, even if they have not completed their own actions for the 
current phase.)
</p>

<p>
At the end of each phase, once all five chefs have each performed an action, it is time to feed
the Duckchess. Assuming all instructions have been followed correctly, one of the pots should
contain the ingredients of one of the recipes on the list of recipes. This delicious concoction
should be fed to the Duckchess (leaving that pot empty), and then the Duckchess will take the
action listed at the end of the recipe. Note that the Duckchess's actions may change the 
rules outlined in this introduction; when a Duckchess's rule change contradicts an initial 
rule, the new rule should always be prioritized.
</p>

<p>
The items in the royal pantry are also listed below. There is only one instance of each item
in the pantry, so once it is removed it is unavailable when future chefs visit the pantry. 
In addition to the pantry items, the chef have access to an unlimited supply of pepper, and 
each chef has access to an unlimited supply of their own signature ingredient.
</p>

<p>
Note that any ingredients may be added to or removed from any pot at any time, if instructions
say to do so. For example, you might think it is impossible to remove the cheese from a mixture of cheese 
and butter, or that after putting fifteen tablespoons of pepper in a pot, it is impossible to remove
six of those tablespoons. You would be wrong, and you should be embarrassed about your lack of
imagination. Clearly you had boring toys as a child.
</p>

<p><b>FRIENDLY ADVICE:</b> Keep track of what has previously occurred,
not just the current state of affairs! If you make a mistake and have
to retrace your steps, it'll be much more bearable to back up a step or
two than start from square one.

<h3>Recipes</h3>

<h4>Bacon-Wrapped Bonanza</h4>
<b>Ingredients:</b> Bacon, scallops, apricot, avocado, gruy&egrave;re, add pepper to taste<br>
<b>Effect:</b> The Duckchess thinks this is delicious! But, as with
most things, it could use more cheese. Take all the remaining cheeses
from the pantry and place them in alphabetical order. Then, put the
first three into the pot previously contained this recipe; put each
additional cheese in the next pot proceeding clockwise, continuing one
cheese per pot until the cheeses are all used.

<h4>The Big Kahuna</h4>
<b>Ingredients:</b> Pork, pumpkin, spinach, havarti, bordelaise sauce, add pepper to taste</b><br>
<b>Effect:</b> The Duckchess knows that on paper, it sounds like these
ingredients would fit together perfectly; but in practice, this just
tastes horrible. The Duckchess spits this into the garbage and instead
eats the contents of the pot diametrically opposite this one on the
table (leaving both empty). Also, take anything on the cutting board
of the last chef to add an ingredient to this pot and throw it away.

<h4>Cheesy Kettle Corn</h4>
<b>Ingredients:</b> Corn, butterscotch sauce, gouda, butter, kosher salt, add pepper to taste<br>
<b>Effect:</b> It's salty... but it's sweet. It's sweet... but it's 
salty. The Duckchess is so confused! She thinks the chefs should be
confused too. Rotate all the cutting boards clockwise, so that 
each chef now has the cutting board that previously belonged to the
chef on their immediate right.

<h4>Judgment-Free Calzone</h4>
<b>Ingredients:</b> Duck, duck sauce, any three cheeses, add pepper to taste<br>
<b>Effect:</b> Do not judge the Duckchess. She has seen horrors that you
have not. Cannibalism is a natural coping mechanism. Let us never speak
of this again, and just to help avoid the subject, add the same amount
of pepper to the now-empty pot that was in it before the Duckchess
devoured one of her own kind. Nothing happened here. Nothing.

<h4>The Meat Munch</h4>
<b>Ingredients:</b> Any five proteins, add pepper to taste<br>
<b>Effect:</b> You've turned the Duckchess's world upside down. From
now on, the order of chefs within each phase is reversed. (So, the chef
whose action name is last alphabetically goes first, and so on.)

<h4>Secret Souffle</h4>
<b>Ingredients:</b> Shrimp, oyster sauce, rum, any three vegetables, add pepper to taste<br>
<b>Effect:</b> The Duckchess loves this so much, she's going to reveal
her secret message! Highlight all of the adjectives in the instructions
you've followed so far, and circle every ninth one. The second letters
of the circled words will give a message that describes two of the 
instructions; remove those two instructions from the list, and repeat
this process on the remaining instructions; repeat this until you get a
single word. Don't worry, there isn't any rum in the pantry.

<h4>Southern Flavortown Cheesesteak</h4>
<b>Ingredients:</b> Steak, cheddar, okra, donkey sauce, add pepper to taste<br>
<b>Effect:</b> That makes the Duckchess want to shake things up! Put this now-empty
pot between Emerald and Jordan, and rearrange all the other pots, 
without tampering with their ingredients, to proceed counterclockwise 
in increasing order of pepper content. (Each of them should have a 
different amount of pepper in it at the moment.)

<h4>Tasty Teamwork</h4>
<b>Ingredients:</b> Butter, donkey sauce, kosher salt, okra, scallops, any additional ingredients desired, add pepper to taste<br>
<b>Effect:</b> The improbable cooperation involved in preparing this dish
rips a hole in the fabric of time and space, opening a portal to the
high-gravity realm of Zyzzlvaria. The Duckchess leaps in and with tremendous
force of bill, she heroically 
prevents our galaxy from collapsing in on itself. But before the tear is 
completely sealed, every fruit or vegetable contained in a pot is sucked
into the void. Except for pots that also contain kosher salt, which are
immune to Zyzzlvarian gravity. It's very important to use kosher salt.

<h4>Thanksgiving Thunder</h4>
<b>Ingredients:</b> Turkey, buffalo, buffalo sauce, okra, any other vegetables desired, add pepper to taste<br>
<b>Effect:</b> The Duckchess appreciates that you used all parts of
the buffalo: the meat and the sauce. For each pot (other than the
now-empty one) that does not contain a sauce, add a sauce from this
pantry that starts with the same letter as a protein in the pot. If
you have a choice of proteins or a choice of sauces, always choose the
one with the shortest name.

<h4>White Eggplant Parmesan</h4>
<b>Ingredients:</b> Eggplant, mozzarella, parmesan, kosher salt, butter, add pepper to taste<br>
<b>Effect:</b> No sauce? The Duckchess thinks your cooking is bland and 
pedestrian. Add two tablespoons of pepper to each of the pots that
currently contain exactly one non-pepper ingredient.

<h3>Instructions for Dude Fiery (signature ingredient: donkey sauce, which counts as a sauce)</h3>

<p><b>BROIL (0 tbsp pepper):</b> The first thing we want to do is bring some meat 
to this party! Get two proteins from the pantry; your first protein 
should be an anagram of the last name of an English poet born on Halloween, and your 
second protein's first syllable should rhyme with your first protein. 
Cut each of these into four servings. Put a serving of the first 
protein into the pot in front of you, and then a serving of the second 
into each of the pots next to that pot. The remaining five servings should
be placed in a line on your cutting board, so that the servings 
alternate from left to right. Those meats are gonna need some flavor, 
so throw some donkey sauce in the left and middle pots, and shake 
three tablespoons of pepper into each of the three pots. Rock and roll.
</p>

<p>
<b>BLEND (2 tbsp pepper):</b> Whooo, there's a lot of pepper in these pots! Just how 
you like it. Rotate the lazy Susan one position so the most peppery pot
on the table is right in front of you. Go to the pantry and find an
ingredient with a name that starts with the name of a city in Utah.
(Mental note: Go visit some diners there some time.) Put that ingredient
in the pot in front of you, and add one tablespoon of pepper, just to
get it up to triple the pepper in one of the pots next to it. The three
servings of food on your cutting board have been there for a while now,
and they're starting to get a bit rank. Throw the leftmost serving
into the pot to your right, and throw the other two servings in the 
garbage. To replace them in the on deck circle (well, rectangle), get 
a fruit from the pantry that anagrams to an adjective that was the 
nicest thing any reviewer had to say about the five-cent Double-Delicious
Donkwings at your latest restaurant. Put that fruit on your cutting 
board, and think about actually using it. Lastly, there should be two 
adjacent pots on the table containing your world-famous donkey sauce; 
switch the positions of those two pots, and add one tablespoon of
pepper to each of them.
</p>

<p><b>CODDLE (4 tbsp pepper):</b> The pot that just showed up in front of you seems like 
it would make a nice traditional dish if you just added some milk and
did some mashing. But you did the shopping this week, so naturally the
pantry is missing many things that any sensible person would have on 
hand. As a substitute, put some donkey sauce in there, and put the
rightmost serving on your cutting board in too. One of the three closest pots
to you is empty except for pepper; give that a taste. Hmmm... needs more
pepper. Throw twelve more tablespoons in there. And just so the pepper
doesn't get lonely, go to the pantry and get a cheese that makes a
common English word if you read its letters backwards. Add that to the
pot to your right, and put the now rightmost serving on your cutting board
in the pot to your left. Now you're cooking' with gas! Or electricity.
Actually, are these burners even on? How do you cook stuff on a lazy
Susan?
</p>

<p>
<b>BASTE (5 tbsp pepper):</b> Go to the pantry and get two fruit ingredients;
you reviewed a wacky diner in Florida last week, so pick up the
state fruit of Florida. And a kid there said you looked like Beaker,
so pick up the fruit that shares its name with the guy who hangs around
with Beaker. Put those ingredients on your cutting board, with the 
brighter-colored one on the right. Now rotate the lazy Susan clockwise
until the pot in front of you contains ingredients that start with the
same letters as each of your cutting board ingredients. That pot has
more pepper in it than either of the pots next to it; add pepper to
those pots until all three have the same amount. Those two pots are
missing something else... of course! Donkey sauce! Throw some of that
in there, and then turn the lazy Susan so that those two pots end up
in front of Milton and Jordan. They should use more donkey sauce.
</p>

<p>
<b>DRAIN (9 tbsp pepper):</b> You don't usually taste during the cooking 
process... oh, who are you kidding, you almost always taste during the
cooking process. Take a sip from each of the three pots closest to you.
One of them has a strong citrus taste... put three tablespoons of 
pepper in that one. One of them has a major kick from the sauce but 
also a pungent smell from the cheese; it doesn't need both of those,
so remove the cheese and put it on your cutting board. The third pot
doesn't taste like anything except pepper; I guess that's what happens
when you put 26 tablespoons of pepper in one pot. Remove half of that
pepper, and add in... let's see... how about that cheese you just took
out? And some donkey sauce. And the protein on the cutting board to
your left. And 15 tablespoons of pepper. Oh, you are a true artist.
</p>

<p>
<b>GLAZE (12 tbsp pepper):</b> It's not Halloween, so resist the urge to stick your
face into the pot in front of you. (Though that is generally something
you do at least once when cooking any meal.) What would really go well
in that pot, though, is a fruit that contains two common nicknames,
one male and one female, that don't overlap. Get that from the pantry
and put it in the pot in front of you, along with some... what the?!
Can nobody at this table keep their ingredients to themselves? Take the
unwanted ingredient on your cutting board and put it in the rightmost 
position on the cutting board of the chef to your right. Then go back
to the pantry and get the two ingredients that have the shortest names 
containing the letter I. Put the ingredient with more I's into the pot
to your right. And throw the other ingredient at the chef that has two
separated servings of the same fruit on his cutting board. Take that,
Poindexter.
</p>

<p>
<b>SPRINKLE (18 tbsp pepper):</b> Auugggggh!!! It burns!!! It burns!!! This is the
worst pain you've experienced since the last evaluation before you
dropped out of cooking school. And that was emotional pain, which 
was a lot less stabby. Extract the item that damaged you and put it on
your cutting board. 
Then rotate the lazy Susan clockwise one position for each
tablespoon of pepper that was on that item. One of the (gaaaaah!)
three pots closest to you now is empty. Take the sauce on your cutting
board and add it to that pot. Then put one tablespoon of pepper in
that (urrrrrgggh!) pot for each letter in the name of that sauce.
Finally, take the sauce out of the pot immediately to your right,
and drink it in its entirety. Mainly so the other chefs think that's
the reason you're currently crying.
</p>

<p>
<b>DEBONE (21 tbsp pepper):</b> Of the three pots closest to you, one of them contains
every type of pantry ingredient except fruit. Add one tablespoon of
pepper to that pot for every non-pepper ingredient the pot contains. 
Then, to complete the set, put the fruit from your cutting board in as 
well. Now rotate the lazy Susan so that that pot is immediately to
your left. Go to the pantry and pick up the non-vegetable ingredient
with the longest name. (Remember, lift with your legs, not your back.)
There are two pots on the table with the same number of tablespoons of
pepper, and one of them contains donkey sauce. Chuck your new ingredient
into that pot, which should splash that sauce (and half the pepper in 
that pot) entirely out of the pot and onto the nearest chef's apron. 
That's what he gets for being the innocent victim of your pointless rage.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Instructions for Emerald Degrassi (signature ingredient: okra, which counts as a vegetable)</h3>

<p><b>STIR (0 tbsp pepper):</b> Okay, people, let's kick it up a smidge. First, go to the
pantry and get a crustacean from the protein section and a spicy sauce,
so that the first letter of the sauce immediately follows the first letter of the 
protein in the alphabet. Go ahead and put all that sauce in the pot in
front of you, and put the protein on your cutting board. Blam! Blam! Blam!
Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! By the way, whenever you shout "blam," you 
should put 2 tablespoons of pepper into a pot. Always start with the
pot immediately to the left of the pot you most recently put something
into, and then proceed one pot to the left for each additional blam.
(Those last two didn't count. You need the exclamation point.)
So in this case, you should now have put something into every pot except
the one to your right. Go grab a fruit-vegetable pair in which both items have the
same number of letters and start with the same letter, and put 'em both
in that last pot. Blam!
</p>

<p>
<b>BROWN (3 tbsp pepper):</b> The chef nearest to the pot with the pumpkin in
it has been seriously misbehaving. You think it's time somebody did
something about it. Go to the pantry and get a vegetable that rhymes
with the plural of a talking bird. Bring that back to your cutting board
and split it up into five servings. Now glue those servings together
with some melted okra in the shape of a person.
Oh, she's looking your way, look busy! Put four
tablespoons of pepper in the pot to your left, and move the sauce from
the pot in front of you into that pot. Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Okay, 
she looked away. Rotate the lazy Susan three positions clockwise,
so that there's a very hot sauce in front of you. Take the veggie-doll,
pitch it into that pot, and wait to see what happens.
</p>

<p><b>SIMMER (5 tbsp pepper):</b> What in the world is going on with that pot to your
right? Talk about your weird flavor profiles. Take the non-seafood
protein from that pot and move it to the pot in front of you. Then, take 
the item on your cutting board, and put it in the pot on your right. 
Still pretty weird, but at least the proteins make sense. Blam! Now
let's get something new to work with... Go to the pantry and find a
protein and a cheese that each have a double letter in their name (by
which I mean the same letter twice in a row), and make sure those letters
come from the same half of the alphabet. Okay? Now put the cheese in the
pot to your left, along with some nice okra, and put the protein on your
cutting board. Blam! Speaking of which, one of the three pots in front of
you has twice as much pepper as one of the others. Put three tablespoons
of pepper into the third pot.
</p>

<p>
<b>TOAST (7 tbsp pepper):</b> Now THAT seems to have done it. Your creation has risen
to its feet and is shuffling back and forth. Awww, the poor thing
looks hungry! And if it's anything like its daddy, it has a refined
palate, so go get a protein from the pantry with a name that ends
with the name of a four-letter herb. It doesn't seem interested...
so discard that ingredient into the pot immediately to the right of the
pot on the table that contains seven different non-pepper ingredients.
Rotate the lazy Susan two positions clockwise (so that multiple
seafood items are in the pot in front of you), and then observe as 
your creation takes a giant bite out of the arm of the chef 
immediately to your right. Oh, so that's what it eats! 
Who knew? Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam!
</p>

<p>
<b>LIQUEFY (10 tbsp pepper):</b> There should be two pots on the table that have exactly
four non-pepper ingredients. Of those two pots, one contains an ingredient
which is also on your cutting board; rotate the lazy Susan until that
pot is directly in front of you. It's already got fruit and sauce in it,
so add the third ingredient from your cutting board, plus two tablespoons
of pepper. Two of the three
pots closest to you contain sauce, but the other doesn't. You could
throw in the sauce on your cutting board, but that doesn't seem quite
right. To the pantry! One of the sauces there has a name in which every
letter present appears exactly twice. Take that sauce, put it in the
sauceless pot. Which is no longer sauceless. Blam! There should now
be exactly one pot on the table (call it Pot A) that has exactly twice 
as much pepper as another on the table (call that Pot B). Ignoring chefs'
signature ingredients, find the only ingredient in the pantry that has the
same first letter as an ingredient in Pot B, and the same third letter as
an ingredient in Pot A. Put that new ingredient in the pot on the table
with the least pepper. Blam!
</p>

<p>
<b>POACH (12 tbsp pepper):</b> You can't help but notice that everybody else at the
table has been engaged in blood-feuds and tantrums, and apart from
some compulsive catch-phrase-related behavior, you've been pretty 
normal. So it's probably time to use voodoo magic to raise a zombie
sous-chef. Go to the pantry and get a sauce, the first three letters
of which describe where you're going to want to go when all of this
is over. Also pick up the only vegetable that starts with the spelled
out name of a Greek letter. And some soy sauce, because who doesn't
like soy sauce? Cover the item on your cutting board in the first 
sauce, stick the vegetable onto the item in the shape of a face, and 
stick the makeshift head you just assembled onto the headless corpse 
you always bring with you just 
in case. Place the now-headed body on the ground to your right. While
you're waiting for him to rise and do your bidding, put the soy sauce
and some okra into the pot to your right.
Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam!
Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam!
(There were twenty of those. You're welcome.)
</p>

<p>
<b>FLAMBE (13 tbsp pepper):</b> This zombie (well, pombie is probably more accurate)
is clearly defective; it's still lying there motionless. According
to your voodoo cookbook you need a body... check. A decorated fruit
head... check. Some pepper... grab a tablespoon of pepper from the pot
in front of the chef to your right and rub it on the pombie. Still nothing.
Let's see... according to this recipe, the pombie needs to be 
exposed to a truly unholy act to give it life. That stabbing was pretty
graphic; grab the weapon from the cutting board to your left and jam
it into the pombie's side. Nope. Maybe a ritual sacrifice; take the 
cheese-based weapon in the pot immediately to your right, and throw
it into the pot elsewhere on the table that has deer meat in it. Yeah, 
you're not really surprised that didn't work. Blam! Blam! Blam! This
raising the dead thing isn't panning out as you'd hoped. Turn the
lazy Susan until there's a pot in front of you containing butter and
two cheeses; add okra to that pot and sulk.
</p>

<p>
<b>DICE (14 tbsp pepper):</b> It seems like the pot in front of you contains just
about everything, so you might as well put the ingredient on your cutting
board in there too. And some okra. Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! You could change
four of the middle five letters in the name of one of the ingredients 
in that pot to get the name of an ingredient in the pantry. Get that 
item from the pantry, along with another ingredient that starts with
the same letter but isn't a cheese. Divide that second ingredient into
two servings, and toss one of those servings into the only pot on the
table that just contains pepper. Put the other serving on your cutting
board, and put the first ingredient on your cutting board to the right
of that.
</p>

<h3>Instructions for Jordan Sheepsley (signature ingredient: scallops, which counts as a protein)</h3>

<p><b>FRY (0 tbsp pepper):</b> Dear God, who cleaned this cookware? It's dreadful.
All right then, get some bleeping ingredients from the pantry, 
specifically a protein, a fruit, a vegetable, and a cheese, so that all 
of them start with the same bleeping letter, each of them has the same 
number of letters as exactly one of the others, and none of them contains 
a bleeping letter U. Cut them each into two servings, and arrange them 
on your cutting board from left to right in alphabetical order. Then take
the second, fifth, and eighth servings from the left, and put them in the 
pot to your left, the pot in front of you, and the pot to your right 
respectively. Finally, put five tablespoons of pepper into each of those three pots, 
and turn the lazy Susan four positions counterclockwise so that these
are somebody else's bleeping problem.
</p>

<p>
<b>KNEAD (4 tbsp pepper):</b> Did someone literally just throw bleeping food across 
the table?
Is this amateur hour? All right, take a look at what you've got to
work with. There's a lot going on in the pot to your left; add some scallops
and four tablespoons of pepper and then leave that alone. The pot on
the right seems close to done; go to the pantry and get an ingredient
with a name that anagrams to a word for a female relative. No, not a
bloody dragontherm! Come on... Take that ingredient, put it in the pot
on your right. Now the pot in front of you, there's some promise there.
Take the leftmost and rightmost ingredients on your cutting board and put
it in that pot. Frankly, there's pepper to spare in there (especially
given the sauce), and some of these
other chefs wouldn't know a bleeping flavor profile if it bit them on
the arse. So take all the pepper out of that pot except for two 
tablespoons, and equally distribute the removed pepper into all the 
pots on the table that contain kosher salt. (If you have to use
fractions of tablespoons to do so, something's gone wrong.) There,
that at least resembles progress.
</p>
 
<p><b>MINCE (5 tbsp pepper):</b> Oh dear, oh dear, what are these other chefs thinking?
Why does the pot to your left contain nothing but sauce and pepper? Who would bleeping 
eat that? Go to the pantry and pick out a protein with a name that contains
the reversed name of a trigonometric function, and a vegetable with a
name that starts with a type of shoe. Drop both of those in the previously
mentioned pot, and then put scallops in all three of the pots closest to
you. Now, there are two servings of one ingredient on your cutting board.
Those were supposed to be for the red team and the blue team, but since
they didn't bleeping show up, put one serving in the pot in front of you
and throw the other serving away. And last off, take eight stunning 
tablespoons of pepper, and dump half of it into the pot in front of you, 
and the other half in the pot to your left. Bloody hell.
</p>

<p>
<b>HUSK (6 tbsp pepper):</b> You really can't imagine what these people are trying
to make. It smells like someone bleeping died in here. Rotate the
bloody lazy Susan so that the number of tablespoons of pepper in the
pot in front of you is a perfect square but not a perfect fourth power.
Of the two ingredients on your cutting board (and by the way, how the
hell did those get there?), one of them is already present in a pot
nearby; take the serving on your board, and take the serving in the pot,
and chuck them both in the bin because they're RAW! (And yes, they're
probably supposed to be raw, but that's not the point!) 
Now take the other ingredient on your cutting board, and put it in the 
pot in front of you. Seems like a bad idea, but you know what? It's been 
that kind of a day. And meanwhile, people are overseasoning everything 
in sight; in each of the three pots in front of you, get rid of one
tablespoon of pepper, and then get rid of half of what remains. The
new total of those pots should be a much more reasonable 19 tablespoons
of pepper. The Duckchess eats that in an average midnight snack.
</p>
 
<p>
<b>GARNISH (11 tbsp pepper):</b> There is not enough bloody competition in
this kitchen. From here on, declare the two chefs to your left to be
the red team, and the two chefs to your right to be the blue team.
And place some scallops on the cutting boards to your left and right,
because everyone bleeping knows that if you don't know how to bleeping
cook, you'll end up putting bleeping raw scallops on the plate! Now,
turn the lazy Susan so that the two pots directly in front of red
team chefs have the same total amount of pepper as the two pots
directly in front of the blue team chefs. In addition to the pepper,
each of those four pots contains the same number of non-pepper
ingredients, except for one that contains two more than the others.
Well, that's not bleeping fair! Go to that pot, take the two vegetables
out, and put them on your cutting board. Then smack that chef on the
back of the head for cheating. Bloody twerp.
</p> 
 
<p>
<b>PUREE (15 tbsp pepper):</b> Spin the bloody lazy Susan so that the empty pot
is directly in front of you. It's high time you did something with that
ingredient on your cutting board. Put it in the empty pot and add three
tablespoons of pepper. You're also going to need a stunning sauce, so go to the
pantry, get one with the same number of bleeping letters as the
ingredient you put in, and add that sauce to the pot as well. That's
enough work on your own recipe, maybe you should start fixing these
other disasters. There are two pots (next to each other on the table)
that have both a prime number of non-pepper ingredients and a prime 
number of tablespoons of pepper. Everybody knows prime numbers taste
like a duck's dinner, so add a tablespoon of pepper to each of those 
pots. One of them still has a prime number of tablespoons! Bloody hell!
Remove the longest-named fruit from that pot, wipe it off, and
put it on your cutting board. Somebody'll find some bleeping thing to do 
with it.
</p> 

<p>
<b>ROAST (16 tbsp pepper):</b> What is going on here? This is supposed to be a
bleeping kitchen and it's more like a bleeping science fiction movie. 
It looks like you're going to have to be the one who ensures something 
useful 
actually gets made. The pots in front of the chefs to your left and
right each have a sauce in them; extract those bleeping sauces and
switch their positions. Now that you've done their work for them,
take a look at the pots nearest to you... Oh bloody hell, is 
someone just using one of them to melt butter? Go to the bloody
pantry, take five 
non-protein ingredients that start with the same letter of the
alphabet, and put them all in that pot. And then, for each one of
those five ingredients that has a name containing the letter B, put a
tablespoon of pepper in that pot. Now hopefully things will go 
smoothly, because if one more bleeping chef pulls one more bleeping
idiotic stunt, you're going to go out of your bleeping mind. 
</p> 
 
<p>
<b>STEAM (21 tbsp pepper):</b> ALL RIGHT, SHUT IT DOWN!!! This kitchen is a bleeping
disgrace, and you did not come here to be attacked by fruit creatures! 
Forcibly kick every bleeping chef out of the room, whether 
they have more actions they were going to carry out or not. You are 
DONE here. This is FINISHED. And you're starting to feel a bit woozy. 
Look at this bleeping disaster. Most of these ingredients don't even 
mean anything; the only thing anyone got right is the amount of bleeping 
pepper in each pot, which seems to perfectly embody the Duckchess's most 
important dinner request. But apart from... huh, the room's spinning
a bit... stupid bleeding chefs... you... ugh... nrrrrggggh... 
bleeeeeeeeping braaaaaaaaaaaains...

<h3>Instructions for Milton Taupe (signature ingredient: kosher salt)</h3>

<p><b>HEAT (0 tbsp pepper):</b> Now this first ingredient you're going to grab from the
pantry is a versatile vegetable also known as the aubergine. You'll also
need two cheeses that both end in the same two letters, and a protein 
that has no letters in common with any of the other three ingredients.
Of these ingredients, one of them begins with the name of a mythical
creature; put that in the pot to your left, along with some kosher salt. 
It's very important that you use kosher salt.
One of the others begins with the name of another food; put that in the
pot to your right, along with some kosher salt. Of the remaining two,
take the one with the shorter name and leave it on your cutting board;
put the remaining one in the pot to your right. You should also get a sauce going, so fetch one from the pantry 
that's named for a French wine region, and put it in the pot in front
of you. Finally, put two tablespoons of pepper into each of the three
nearest pots.
</p>

<p><b>MIX (2 tbsp pepper):</b> Add some pepper to one of the three pots closest to you so that the 
numbers of tablespoons of pepper in these pots are consecutive (in 
some order), and none of them have the same amount of pepper as any 
other pot on the table. Add some kosher salt to the only one of these 
three pots that doesn't contain any protein. It's very important that 
you use kosher salt. Now, it's a common misconception that one of the 
cheeses left in the pantry is named after a sitcom character played by 
Fred Gwynne, though the added third letter dispels that myth pretty 
quickly. Still, grab that cheese and grate it into the nearest pot 
that doesn't contain any cheese. Last off, the pot on the table with 
the most pepper is in front of a chef who should really learn to make 
dishes that are nutritious as well as delicious. Go to the pantry and 
get two vegetables that each have a double consonant (repeated twice 
in a row) without a third instance of that consonant. Put those 
vegetables on that chef's cutting board, and take the ingredient that 
was on the cutting board and eat it. That's good eats! (Leave the 
remnants of that ingredient on the ground to your right.) 
</p>

<p>
<b>GRIND (3 tbsp pepper):</b> No, no, no, this won't do at all. After all
this cooking and all this advice, none of the pots except the one
in front of you has a single vegetable in it? You pride yourself
on your patience with rookie chefs, but this is frankly unacceptable.
Shut down this kitchen, and get all of the other chefs out of here.
Before you leave, maybe you can salvage these dinners; go to the
pantry, take every vegetable in sight, and place them in the pots
so that the vegetable with the longest name goes in the pot with
the most pepper, the second longest in the pot with the second-most
pepper, and so on. Huh. Those vegetables certainly ended up in an
interesting order around the table.
</p>

<p>
<b>MELT (5 tbsp pepper):</b> You feel alive for the very first time in your life.
No one pushes Milton Taupe around ever again, from this day forward!
Remove one tablespoon of pepper from each of the three pots nearest
to you, and rub the pepper on your face like war paint, along with some
kosher salt. It's very important that you use kosher salt. Two of those
three pots contain six non-pepper ingredients, and those pots have
one ingredient in common; remove that ingredient in an effort to 
make these dishes a bit more nutritious. Now rotate the lazy Susan
until the three pots nearest to you each contain four non-pepper
ingredients. There is a set of three ingredients, one in each of these 
pots that starts with the same letter. Remove and discard all three.
You know, after all that violence, cooking is just dull. Stomp on 
the foot of the chef to your right, and make it clear that it wasn't
an accident. That's just how you roll now.
</p>

<p>
<b>CHILL (6 tbsp pepper):</b> Breathe in. Breathe out. Calmly clean off your
sauce-stained apron with a moist towelette. Calmly stir the pot
immediately to your right, and add an ingredient from the pantry
that begins with the name of a continent. Calmly add a tablespoon
of pepper to the only pot on the table that contains three different
cheeses. Calmly pick up the object 
on your cutting board. Calmly walk over to the chef who keeps throwing 
food in your direction. Calmly stab him in the neck with the object
twelve times. Then, before returning to your station, calmly rub 
liberal amounts of kosher salt in the resulting wound. It's very 
important that you use kosher salt.
</p>

<p>
<b>PICKLE (7 tbsp pepper):</b> What a waste of perfectly good soft 
cow's milk cheese; wipe it off your face and reluctantly discard it.
But the monkeyshines of an immature bully will not stand in the way
of good eats. Turn the lazy Susan so that the pot in front of the
cheese-thrower is now in front of you. Two of the three pots in front
of you each contain exactly two non-pepper ingredients; add three
tablespoons of pepper to the other pot. As far as the first two pots
go, neither contains any sauce, and that should be remedied. For the
pot that doesn't contain any cheese, add a sauce from the pantry with
a name containing a four letter word for "podium." Add a sauce to the
other pot with a name that contains a three-letter Asian mammal. Just
to finish things off, add two things to the pot directly in front of 
you: the leftmost ingredient on your cutting board and some kosher
salt. It's very important that you use kosher salt.
</p>

<p>
<b>SHIRR (8 tbsp pepper):</b> It's a common culinary misconception that you
can only eat the sauce you should get from the pantry in months that
contain the letter R; but while that's debatably true for the namesake 
shellfish,
the sauce contains such minimal amounts of it that you'll be fine
year round. In fact, just to demonstrate that fact, call the pot
in front of you January, the pot to its right February, and so on around
the table until you get to October. Then, put some of the sauce in every
pot corresponding to a month that DOESN'T contain an R. Of those pots,
two of them contain butter; you should add some kosher salt to the other
two. It's very important that you use kosher salt. It occurs to you
that the ingredient on your cutting board should probably be used
sooner rather than later, but it doesn't seem like it would fit in 
with the ingredients in the pot directly in front of you. Turn the
lazy Susan so the "April" pot is in front of you. Ah, now that's more
like it. Put in the ingredient from your cutting board, along with five
tablespoons of pepper.
</p>

<p><b>BRAISE (9 tbsp pepper):</b> Here's a little-known fact about cooking; ingredients
that rhyme are essentially interchangeable once you put them through
a food processor (and you should put everything through a food processor).
So for example, right now it would be nice to have some strips of dried
salted meat and some coffee, but we don't have any of those, so go to
the pantry and get two items that rhyme with them. (For the coffee, get
something that rhymes with a slang term that's also an island in 
Southeast Asia.) Of these items, take the protein, divide it into two
servings, and put it in the pot to your left and the pot in front of
you. Also, put some kosher salt in the pot to your left and the pot
to your right. It's very important that you use kosher salt.
As for the fruit, divide that into two servings as well, and put them
on your cutting board so that the fruit servings are on the left and
right, and the other item is in the middle. Then turn the lazy Susan 
three positions counterclockwise, just to keep folks on their toes.
Oh, and add a tablespoon of pepper to the pot that's now on your right,
because whoever recently took a tablespoon out of that pot clearly
didn't know what they were doing.
</p>

<h3>Instructions for Pauletta Spleen (signature ingredient: butter)</h3>

<p><b>WHISK (0 tbsp pepper):</b> Now before we do anything else here, you're gonna want to
put some butter into the pot to your left and the pot to your right. Mix
it in there real good. Okay, now rotate that lazy Susan just about three 
positions clockwise. There should be one non-pepper ingredient in the 
pot to your right now. 
Go to the pantry and get the two ingredients from that same
category that have the longest names. You can just throw the longest one
in the garbage, we won't need it, but empty the other one into the pot
in front of you. Now I've heard that vegetables are extremely good for
your heart, so let's ignore those and pick out a few cheeses. You're
gonna want two cheeses that start with the same letter; just make sure
neither of them shares its name with a New England college. Of those,
take the one with the most repeated letters and put it on your cutting 
board. Put the other in the pot in front of you, along with, oh, let's
say 8 tablespoons of pepper. And some butter. And 3 more tablespoons
of pepper. Next, rotate the lazy Susan so the only pot that contains
nothing but pepper is right in front of you. Finally, there's a pot in
front of another chef that contains exactly 4 tablespoons of pepper;
remove one tablespoon of pepper and throw it away.
</p>

<p><b>JULIENNE (2 tbsp pepper):</b> First off, why don't you turn the lazy Susan so that
fancy European sauce nearby becomes as far away from you as possible. 
Not a fan of Europe. Too many ethnicities. Of the three pots now
closest to you, one has significantly less pepper than the others; double
the amount of pepper in that pot, and add some butter. I've been told
that we need some fruits and vegetables, but I'll be damned if we're
gonna use something green, so go to the pantry and pick up the two
produce items that are the most yellow. No, not the mango.
Of these, put the vegetable in
the pot in front of you, and put the fruit in the leftmost position
on your cutting board. That pot in front of you is looking good enough
to eat; in fact, you'd better pick up the pot in front of you and the
pot to your left and switch their positions so you don't actually eat
it.
</p>

<p>
<b>CHOP (4 tbsp pepper):</b> At this point, nine out of ten of the pots on
the table have butter in them. Well now, you know what they call that
in the Deep South? A good start. Turn the lazy Susan so that the
only butterless pot is directly in front of you; no, actually turn it
so that pot is immediately to your right. That way you can sneak up on
it. Add butter to that pot (naturally) and also add three tablespoons
of pepper to each of the three pots closest to you. There's another
ingredient that would be perfect for the pot to your left, but it's
currently on the cutting board to your right, and the chef over there
looks like he's planning to make use of it. Distract him by removing 
the sauce from the pot in front of him and hurling it into his eyes.
Then, while he's writhing in pain, put the previously mentioned
ingredient in the pot to your left, along with some of that chef's
signature ingredient. You know, for irony.
</p>

<p>
<b>FRAPPE (5 tbsp pepper):</b> Once you notice what ingredients have appeared on
your cutting board, shriek for a good solid minute. Who is trying 
to sabotage your cooking with vitamins and nutrients? This means
gastric war, if you do say so yourself. (And you do.) Immediately
throw the two horrible ingredients in the garbage, and then go
to the pantry for two replacement ingredients. One should have a name
you can form by mixing together the first two letters of each of
the bad ingredients, while the other should have the same last 
letter as one of the bad ingredients and the same penultimate letter
as the other. The one with the fancy name is for cooking; put it,
along with some butter and three tablespoons of pepper, into the
one of the three pots nearest you that has the least pepper in it.
The one with the shorter name is for fighting. Break off an 
appropriate piece of it, and put that piece on your cutting board,
throwing the rest away. Then remove enough pepper from the pot directly
in front of you so that that pot contains the average of the amounts
of pepper in the pots to your left and right. (That average should be
twice the amount of pepper in a pot on the table, and also half the
amount of pepper in another pot on the table. Rub all the removed 
pepper onto the item on your cutting board, and lie in wait.
</p> 

<p>
<b>SAUTE (6 tbsp pepper):</b> Put three tablespoons of pepper into the pot
immediately to your left and then... was that a knock at the door?
Are you being sued again?? Time for y'all to get out of Dodge. Pull
the plug and shut down the kitchen; tell your colleagues to go out
the front door, while you sneak out the back so that you don't end the
day with one more subpoena. Though before you leave, take a look at each
pot that contains butter. Coincidentally, each of those pots also
contains one sauce; look at the amount of pepper in the pot and the 
name of that sauce, and see if it doesn't spell out something interesting.
</p>

<p>
<b>CARVE (9 tbsp pepper):</b> Give that lazy Susan a little spin, turning it clockwise 
until there's a pot directly in front of you that contains butter.
Mmm, mmm. Butter.
Neither the pot immediately to your left or right has any butter, 
and the good lord knows that some butter would improve them, but you 
can't have people thinking you're a one-trick pony. First take the 
ingredient that's been on your cutting board the longest and put it
into the pot to your right, along with four tablespoons of pepper.
The other ingredient on your cutting board has a certain letter
repeated three times. Go to the pantry and find two ingredients that
also have three instances of that letter. Of these, put the one with
fewer total letters in the pot to your left; put the other on the
<i>cutting board</i> of the chef to your right, on top of whatever
he's put there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>PEEL (10 tbsp pepper):</b> Slowly regain consciousness and stand up. 
Hopefully you didn't miss anything particularly important. 
One of the items you're surprised to find on your cutting board is
the remnant of an ingredient from the pantry that has the same
first letter as every non-pepper ingredient in a pot on the table.
Stroll on over and plunk both of the items on your cutting board
(the garbage item and the combo item)
into that pot. After wandering back to your station, you notice
that there are a lot fewer vegetables around than there were earlier. 
You're not sure what happened, but you're certainly not complaining...
Identify the nearest pot to you that contains a seven-letter ingredient,
and for every pot on the table that does contain at least one vegetable, 
remove a tablespoon of pepper from that previously identified pot. 
And to finish up, add some butter into each of the three pots 
closest to you, because why not?
</p>

<p>
<b>WHIP (14 tbsp pepper):</b> And now the time has come to strike! Grab the
devastating weapon on your cutting board and... wait, what happened
to the devastating weapon on your cutting board? Now you appear to
have the symbol of one of the most delightful states in this great
nation of ours. Put that, along with some butter and a tablespoon
of pepper, into the nearby empty pot. Then reach into one of the 
three pots closest to you and extract an ingredient with the same
first and last letters as the state you were just thinking about.
It's probably too crumbly to do physical damage, but go to the pantry
and get a non-cheese ingredient that ends with the same letter.
Smear that all over your replacement weapon, and now at least you
have a missile you can burn somebody's eyes with. The South shall
rise again! Now run toward your sworn enemy, immediately slip
on a discarded object, fall down, and be knocked out. Both your weapon 
and the previously discarded object miraculously land on your cutting 
board.
</p>
