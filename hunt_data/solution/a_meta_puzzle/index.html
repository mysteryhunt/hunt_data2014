<h2>Solution to A Meta Puzzle</h2>
<i>Authors: Harvey Jones and Capen Low</i>

<p>Puzzlers are given a series of North American cities paired with clue phrases. Every clue's solution is a punny phrase that is also a heavy metal or hard rock band's name missing one letter.</p>

<p>Ex.: &quot;This Olympics mascot dude hasn't eaten enough food&quot;</p>

<p>The above clues to the answer THIN IZZY. The phrase is one letter short of the hard rock band Thin Lizzy. So from this clue, we extract the missing letter: L.</p>

<p>Clues are given in alphabetical order by their answer. Additionally, each clue is also associated with a North American city. These locations, when drawn onto a map, describe a somewhat ellipsoid set of points around the continent &ndash; indeed, it is a tour route! The first city listed in the puzzle is Toronto, ON. Toronto is also the only listed city outside the US.</p>

<p>When the missing band letters are placed on a map and read in the cyclic order of the route, they will spell out the fully extracted clue: WRITERSOFTHEPILLORIANAGE, or &quot;Writers of The Pillorian Age&quot;. The Pillorian Age is the sole album released by Norwegian black metallers Abysmal. The puzzle's answer, then, is <b>ABYSMAL</b>.</p>

<p>The full table of clues, their answers, and their associate bands follows:</p>
