<h2>Solution to Sneaky Fox</h2>
<i>Author: James Clark</i>

<p>
When someone uses a Swype-style keyboard to enter text into a
mobile device, the software usually draws a line representing
the path their finger has taken.  Each image in this puzzle
depicts the finger-paths for multiple words in a sentence or
sentence fragment, with the keyboard itself removed.

<p>
The title is a reference to Swiper from Dora the Explorer,
meant to help confirm to the solvers that if they're thinking
about the Swype keyboard then they're on the right track.

<p>
To figure out the text, solvers need to isolate each
indidivual finger-path, map it approximately to a keyboard,
and figure out which word is being entered.

<p>
The path for each word may start at one end or the other, so
solvers have to consider both orderings when guessing the
word.  It will be easier to guess the word if the solvers
find an appropriate image of a swype keyboard and figure out
how to align it onto these images.  For example, swype.com
has some images which, if cropped and scaled properly, should
line up fine.  These images use only the alphabetic letters
of the keyboard, the fourth row is not used.

<p>
For example, here is the fourth image with the keyboard
underneath it:

<p>
<img src="4a.png" width="400">

<p>
And here is one of the words of that image, isolated:

<p>
<img src="4b.png" width="400">

<p>
In this example, it looks like 'E' 'F' and 'A' are probably
letters in the word, since the typist "cornered" on those
letters, and 'S' and 'Y' as well, since those are the
endpoints.  Other letters along the way may be involved,
but the only word that matches SA[D]F[DR]E[RT]Y (or the
other direction, Y[TR]E[RD]F[D]AS) is SAFETY.

<p>
Once solvers have the words, they must determine the phrase
for that image and identify its source.  Each image
corresponds to text delivered in a movie over a phone or some
phone-like device.  Solvers must identify the movies, and use
the parenthesized numbers from the puzzle as indexes into the
movie titles.
