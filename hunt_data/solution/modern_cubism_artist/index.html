<h2>Solution to Modern Cubism Artist</h2>
<i>Author: Roger Hanna Morash</i>

<p>In this puzzle, solvers must deduce how to extract 24 6-letter words from the first image of 24 non-intersecting (but sometimes abutting) triangles.</p>
<p>Each triangle's vertices can be transformed to an integral grid range of values [0,25] corresponding to letters ['A','Z'].</p>
<p>Vertices could be converted to letter chunks as XY or YX, but YX chunks don't form words (except IRISES->SERISI/SIRISE).</p>
<p>Converting each vertex into an XY chunk, there is a single permutation of the vertices that produces a reasonable word, these are the 24 words:</p>
<p>
AUGURY
BEADED
CHAFED
COBRAS
DIGGED
DINGLE
ERASES
FENCED
FUGUES
INDIAN
INKING
INSULT
IRISES
LUXURY
MINING
MINION
NABBED
PERISH
RESCUE
ROPING
SQUISH
SUMMON
THRESH
UPTOWN
</p>
<p>There are some near-miss words some anagrammers may suggest (proper names, locations). Hopefully people didn't get caught up on these: DINGLE>LEDING, INDIAN>DIANIN</p>
<p>The correct 24 6-letter words fit uniquely into the crisscross provided.</p>
<p>Reading top to bottom, left to right the marked letters, you get the answer phrase PASSIONISTHEGENESISOF</p>
<p>The conclusion of the quote is the answer: "GENIUS"</p>
