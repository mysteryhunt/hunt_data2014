	You enter the tea party just in time to hear the Mad Hatter shout at you, "No room! No room!" 
      <p>
	"What are you talking about?" you say. "There's plenty of room." There are four seats at the table, two of which are unoccupied. However, the two empty seats have name tags on them: one says Dormouse, one says The Beast. Also, in front of the hare are four full steaming cups of moon tea. In front of the Dormouse's empty seat are four cups of yule tea. And the Mad Hatter is sipping from one of four cups of Chinese oolong tea. In front of the Beast's seat there is nothing but one empty saucer.
      <p>
	"Why are you guys drinking on opposite sides of the table?" you ask. 	
      <p>
	"Because it's tea time... I think," the Hatter says absent-mindedly. 	
      <p>
	"And how long will it remain tea time?" you ask, stifling your anger. 	
      <p>
	"Can't you see that the beast broke our clock? We have no idea!  If you could fix it, perhaps we could give you some answers," says the Hare. 	
      <p>
	"And how come there's no tea at that place setting?" you ask, pointing to the Beast's chair. 	
      <p>
	"Ah, the first good question you've asked," says the Hatter. "If we knew where the Beast was, we could probably answer that puzzle, the most important puzzle of all." 
      <p>
	Suddenly, the Mad Hatter stands up, spilling tea on the table around him. He immediately shouts to no one in particular, "Move left! Move left!" He then looks around him at the other empty seats, sighs again, and picks up his tea and moves one chair to the left. Afterwards he rearranges the other two name tags, while the March Hare seats himself on the chair that used to be the Dormouse's. You suddenly notice that each of the chairs has puzzling things written on their backs. A few minutes later, they repeat this dance.
      <p>
	The Hatter and the Hare appear to be reminiscing on twelve things he and his friends said when they were all at the tea party together. Find where the character was sitting when they spoke. Then find where the Beast must have been.
