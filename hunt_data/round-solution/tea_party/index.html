<h2>Solution to The Tea Party Meta</h2>

<i>Authors: Aaron Bader and Jonny Surick</i>

<p>There are 4 chair puzzles and 12 teacup puzzles.  Of the teacup puzzles, there are four associated with the Mad Hatter and his tea, chinese oolong, four associated with the March Hare and his tea, moon tea, and four associated with the Dormouse and his tea, yule tea.  The beast (Alice) has no puzzles associated with her -- just an empty saucer indicating that her puzzle is the meta.</p>

<p>The four characters are arranged around the table as follows, going clockwise: the beast, March Hare, Dormouse, Mad Hatter.  While they can shift around seats, this order is always maintained.  [This is stated clearly in the introduction text.]</p>

<p>The answers for each character are associated with three separate "calendars."  The Mad Hatter (oolong tea) answers are associated with the Chinese Zodiac.  The March Hare (moon tea) answers are associated with the Farmers' Almanac moons.  The Dormouse (yule tea) answers are associated with the gifts during the 12 days of Christmas.  The associations are as follows, and form an ordering from 1 to 12:</p>

<table>

<tr><td>Dormouse</td><td>SUZANNE CROUGH</td><td>Partridge in a Pear Tree[1]</td><td>1st Day of Christmas</td></tr>

<p>The solution to the four chairs are arranged around the table as follows:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>12 o' clock:</td><td><tt>poTaTobeeTle</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>3 o' clock:</td><td><tt>sTraighTseTs</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>6 o' clock:</td><td><tt>TesTosTerone</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>9 o' clock:</td><td><tt>operaTorTesT</tt></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Each of these words is 12 letters long.  In addition, the letter T occurs in each place from 1 to 12 exactly once.  To extract the final solution phrase, for each word, identify the relevant number from the calendar, then use the chairs to find which chair the character was sitting in, the determine which chair the beast was sitting in.  Finally, take the appropriate letter from that word (3, 6, 9, or 12) to spell out the final answer, <b>GIVE HIM A HAND</b>.</p>
