<h2>Solution to The Humpty Dumpty Meta</h2>
<i>Authors: Hanna Starobinets, Alina Griner, and Timur Starobinets</i>

<p>Solvers are presented with jigsaw pieces that fit together to form an I Spy style image full of Humpty Dumpty's birthday presents -- and Humpty himself!  As in traditional I Spy images, a poem accompanies the image telling solvers what to search for.  However, the lines of the poem are intentionally ambiguous until paired with an answer word from a puzzle.  For example, there are multiple president's noses in the image (Lincoln on the $5 bill and Jackson on the $20 bill), and only when paired with the answer word REPUBLICAN is it clear that Lincoln's nose is the one to grab.  In addition, most of the objects in the image have a series of dots digitally added to them -- these are braille numerals.  Finding the objects in the order of the poem and indexing into the corresponding answer word by the braille number on the object reads the weakness of the beast <b>EISOPTROPHOBIC</b> (afraid of mirrors).</p>
