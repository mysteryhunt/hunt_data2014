<h2>Solution to The Caucus Race Meta</h2>

<i>Dan Katz</i>

<p>Each bird in the caucus race has two puzzles associated with it: a <i>Yes!</i> puzzle and a <i>No!</i> puzzle.  The answer to each <i>Yes!</i> puzzle is the synonym of a common bird.  The answer to each <i>No!</i> puzzle is the antonym to a common bird.  The ballot can be filled in with the pairs of bird types associated with each caucus race bird's answer.  The order that you fill the birds in is determined uniquely by the length of the common bird types.  In the case of GOOSE and SWIFT (synonym and antonym of GOOSE and SLUGGISH), a + and - are included to mark which side the <i>Yes!</i> bird goes on (+ = <i>Yes!</i>, - = <i>No!</i>).  Taking the highlighted letters from the <i>Yes!</i> bird types in the left column and the highlighted letters from the <i>No!</i> bird types in the right column gives the answer phrase <B>ALLERGIC TO DOWN</B>, a weakness of the beast.
