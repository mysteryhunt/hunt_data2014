<p>Things to notice about the financial statements:</p>
<ul>
<li> There is enough information to match the company profiles to the financial
statements, and so put the financial statements in order.
<li> The number "614050" appears frequently and is in a different font. This
should be the most notable thing about the cash flow statements.
<li> When the statements are put in order, the tax amounts (in the statement of
operations) can be converted to numbers to read "Taxes form a red herring."
<li> Some lines in the Statement of Assets & Liabilities don't add up right:
they're off by a number between 1 and 26.
</ul>

<p>Given the above, the steps to solving this puzzle are:</p>

<h3>Match statements to company descriptions</h3>

<p>This gives an ordering of the financial statements.</p>

<p>The keys to matching are:</p>

<ul>
<li> Size of a company: there are a few initial revenue numbers: 100,000; 50,000; 30,000; 10,000.
<li> Speed a company gets paid or pays its bills: "Receivables days" and "payables days" are well-defined concepts.
<li> Amount of inventory a company holds: Restaurants, for instance, hold inventory only for a few days because most of it is perishable.<br>
Note that the puzzle should be solvable without knowing those things in advance, since "payables days", "receivables days", and "inventory days" are referred to in a company description, and these are google-able.
<li> Interest paid on loans: higher by customers of First Wonderland, lower by customers of the Standard Bank.
<li> "Intangible assets" or brand worth, held by companies with consumer brands
<li> "Goodwill" some companies have accumulated by acquiring companies for more than the acquisitions' book
values
<li> And a few special items, such as:
  <ul>
    <li> legal fees awarded from one company to another
    <li> dividends paid by companies owned by the Red Queen or White King
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Find errors in the financial statements; convert to letters</h3>

<p>These are lines that don't "add up". Each statement has a line off by a value < 26; these can be converted to letters (1 = A, 2 = B, etc) to spell the clue phrase "SEARCHHBSPHARVARDEDU" or Search <a href="http://hbsp.harvard.edu/">hbsp.harvard.edu</a>.</p>

<h3>Search for the out-of-place number</h3>

<p>If you search hbsp.harvard.edu for "614050"&mdash;every company's cash balance at the end of the period, the only number introduced that's not a multiple of 100, and the amount of other items such as legal fees or goodwill&mdash;you get a case with subtitle "The answer is <b>SECONDARY</b>".</p>
