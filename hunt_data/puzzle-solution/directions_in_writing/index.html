<h2>Solution to Directions in Writing</h2>

<p>As suggested by the format, this is a criss-cross or fill-in crossword,
where you are given a blank grid and words to fill it in with. A few features
are unconventional however. The puzzle says to fill in words only 
horizontally (despite the appearance of vertical words in the grid), though the
specified lengths (which match the spaces in the grid) don't correspond
to the lengths of the given words.</p>

<p>The trick is that the grid must be rotated to accommodate all the
words, and intersecting cells actually contain different letters that look
the same when rotated. While this is not practical to do using the Latin
alphabet and is largely dependent on case and font choice, there are 
writing systems which make systematic use of rotational symmetry
(with phonetic correspondences!). Two of
them are Hangul and Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics, which are showcased
in this puzzle.</p>

<p>Looking up some of these names reveals that they are the com-
mon English names for municipal-level places in four regions: Nunavut,
Qu&eacute;bec, North Korea, and South Korea. These include cities, towns,
villages, hamlets, counties, and districts. The English names are usually
transcriptions of a native name in Korean (North Korea and South Korea,
which have slightly different transcription systems), Inuktitut (Nunavut
and Qu&eacute;bec), or Cree (Qu&eacute;bec),
though several of the names in Canada
are not standard transcriptions and many of the places in Nunavut have
entirely different names in English.</p>

<p>The native names, when written in their common non-Latin-based
writing systems (Hangul for Korean and Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics for 
Inuktitut and Cree), match the specified lengths, if the Hangul jamo (letters) are written out separately rather than in blocks as is normally done
(this would be impossible to use in a word grid), and the Syllabics char-
acters are counted based on how many characters they are in Unicode
(digraphs and diacritics not counted separately).</p>

<p>Then the task is just to fill in the grid with these names. Some of
the intersecting letters look slightly different in different orientations, 
depending on your font, but this is only a matter of scaling and the similarity
reflects rotational symmetry inherent to the writing systems, so it is not
just a coincidence that they happen to look similar when rotated. The grid
is uniquely solvable, with the technical exception of &#334;rang
 (&#12615;&#12627;&#12601;&#12623;&#12615;),
which can be filled in in two possible directions; but since it's rotationally
symmetric, this doesn't matter!</p>

<p>Though realizing this fact is not necessary for solving, the grid is
roughly divided into four regions associated with the four geographic 
regions. The top left is Nunavut, the bottom left is Qu&eacute;bec,
 the top right is
North Korea, and the bottom right is South Korea, reflecting the relative
geographical position of the regions (as seen with the Prime Meridian at
the center).</p>

<p>When the grid is filled out, the highlighted squares, in the original
orientation, contain the following rotated characters:</p>

<img src="callinazimuth.png" alt="CALL IN AZIMUTH" />

<p>This is supposed to resemble Latin characters spelling out CALL IN AZIMUTH. The answer is <b>AZIMUTH</b>.</p>
