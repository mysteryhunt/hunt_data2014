<h2>Solution to WAT?</h2>
<i>Author: James Clark</i>

<p>This is a series of cryptograms of translated song lyrics.

<p>
Song lyrics were selected from eight songs that can be hard to understand.  One word in each was replaced with a number word.  The lyrics were then "translated" into a different kind of language game (e.g. pig latin).  Finally a random letter substitution was applied to each one.

<p>
For example, the sixth song is "Burnin' Down the House" by Talking Heads.  The fifth line corresponds to "All wet.  Hey, you might need a raincoat.".  The word "raincoat" was replaced with "five", then the lyrics were translated into Swedish Chef to get "Ell vet. Hey, yuoo meeght need a feefe-a.".  Finally that string was encrypted.

<p>
Here are the data for each cryptogram:

These have been ordered by the replaced word.  Ordering alphabetically by song title and using the number to index into the word it replaces gives the answer <b>CONFRONT</b>.

Here are the lyrics before and after the translation step:

All the things to get and keep getting,
never enough not enough and never ending.
I just thought I'd think about.
And it might be
the four of a knowledge
of a rise above the sky
but could never parallel
the challenge of an acquisition in the
here and now, here and now.

ALL TEH THINGS 2 GIT AN KEEP GETTIN,
NEVR ENUF NOT ENUF AN NEVR ENDIN.

TEH 4 OV A KNOWLEDGE
OV A RIZE ABOV TEH SKY
BUT CUD NEVR PARALLEL
TEH CHALLENGE OV AN ACQUIZISHUN IN DA
HER AN NAO, HER AN NAO.

Hello.  Hello.  Hello.
With the lights out, it's less dangerous.
Here we are now, entertain us.
I feel stupid and three.

A mulatto,
an albino,
a mosquito,

Gonna make a break and take a fake.
I'd like a stinkin achin shake.
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the five.
Gotta see the show, cause then you'll know
the vertigo is gonna grow,
'cause it's so dangerous you'll have to sign a waiver.

Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up. 
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp. 
Down on the corner, out in the street, 
Willy and the Poorboys are playin'.
Bring a one; tap your feet.

All excited but we don't know why.
Maybe it's 'cause we're all gonna die.
And when we do, what's it all for?
Better live now before the grim reaper
come knocking on your door.
Are we gonna let the elevator
bring us down?  Oh no, let's go!
Let's go crazy.  Let's get nuts.
Let's look for the three banana
'til they put us in the truck, let's go!

Here's your ticket, pack your bags, time for jumpin' overboard.
Transportation is here.
Close enough but not too far, maybe you know where you are.
Fightin' fire with fire.
All wet.  Hey, you might need a five.
Shakedown.  Dreams walking in broad daylight.
Three hundred sixty-five degrees.
Burning down the house.

These people round here
wear beaten down
eyes sunk in
three dried faces,
so resigned to what their fate is.
But not us (no never),
no not us (no never).
We are far too young and clever.

I'd studied your cartoons, radio, music, TV, movies, magazines.
Richard said, "Withdrawal in disgust is not the same as apathy."
A smile like the cartoon, tooth for a tooth.
You said that irony was the shackles of youth.
You wore a shirt of seven green, uh-huh.
I never understood the frequency, uh-huh.
