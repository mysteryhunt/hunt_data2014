<h2>Solution to Assemble Me</h2>

<p>
<i>Author: Robert L. Rucinski '99</i>

<p>The flavortext (as well as the included link to the emulator) hints that this is a program for the Commodore 64 (also confirmed by the BASIC program with the command <span class="code">SYS 49152</span>, which is a common command for the C64 to execute a user-defined machine language program).</p>
 
<p>The DATA statements are told to be mixed up, thus requiring them to be "assembled" (jigsaw puzzle-like) correctly to form a working program.</p>
 
<p>To solve this part of the puzzle, you can reference any number of works on the internet such as: <a href="http://www.commodore.ca/manuals/c64_programmers_reference/c64-programmers_reference_guide-05-basic_to_machine_language.pdf">http://www.commodore.ca/manuals/c64_programmers_reference/c64-programmers_reference_guide-05-basic_to_machine_language.pdf</a></p>

<p>First, determine what instructions each line of DATA represents.<br>
The first line of DATA represents the instructions: <span class="code">ADC $C060,Y; STA $C100,Y; INY; CPY #$23; BNE (-16)</span><br>
The second line represents the instructions: <span class="code">BCC (+2); LDA #$2A; JSR $FFD2; INY</span><br>
Etc.</p>

<p>By understanding what the different pieces of code do, it is possible to reconstruct the program (shown below). Input the program, with the DATA lines in the correct order into a C64 emulator (see <a href="ASSEMBLE.D64">ASSEMBLE.D64</a> for a working copy of the final program: mount the disc image in the VICE emulator, then <span class="code">LOAD "ASSEMBLE",8</a> and <span class="code">RUN</span>).</p>
 
<p>The correct order of the DATA statements to make a working program is as follows:</p>

<p class="code">
100 DATA 162,0,185,64,192,32,210,255,200,192,32<br>
110 DATA 208,245,160,0,24,152,121,129,235<br>
120 DATA 121,96,192,153,0,193,200,192,35,208,240<br>
130 DATA 162,0,160,0,169,32,24,30,0,193<br>
140 DATA 144,2,169,42,32,210,255,200<br>
150 DATA 192,8,208,238,232,224,35<br>
160 DATA 208,231,169,13,32,210,255,96<br>
170 DATA 147,13,84,72,69,32,65,78,83,87,69,82,32,84,79,32<br>
180 DATA 84,72,69,32,80,85,90,90,76,69,32,73,83,58,13,13<br>
190 DATA 234,240,225,241,117,133,131,232,71,32,197,209,154<br>
200 DATA 34,45,0,203,155,38,179,185,181,150,19,179,158,175<br>
210 DATA 173,36,157,157,137,167,18,144<br>
220 DATA 256
</p>
 
<p>
When the program is run, the program gives:

;change the 35 bytes of data in lines 190-210 into the graphical output

;Those 35 bytes are essentially a coded way to produce the graphical output.
;This section essentially decodes it into the correct bytes needed to print
;the graphic (see below for how that happens). The encoding uses the C64
;keyboard table at $EB81. Essentially, add the byte position, the C64
;keyboard table value, and the byte to decode it. This has all been done
;so as to encode the solution to the puzzle in the DATA and make it
;impossible to determine the solution from the DATA alone.
