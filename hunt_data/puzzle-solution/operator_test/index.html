<h2>Solution to Operator Test</h2>
<i>Author:  David Wilson</i>

<p>The flavor text makes specific reference to remembering the lessons of the past, and the teams being on a Hunt.  </p>

<p>The answer to each bolded clue is the title of a previous Mystery Hunt puzzle.  The remainder of the clues are of a form that fit with that puzzle, one step before the final solution.  Apply the answer-extraction method from that puzzle to get a word from each group.  </p>

<p>This yields the phrase SWAMP OR LUSTFUL FAMILY GUY CHARACTER, which clues QUAGMIRE.  "Quagmire", however, is not the answer to this puzzle--as before, it's the name of <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2004/vatican/Ta6/">a previous Mystery Hunt puzzle</a>, whose <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2004/vatican/Ta6/answer.html">final extraction step</a> is "call in the title of the puzzle as the answer."  </p>

<p>Answer:  <b>OPERATOR TEST</b></p>

Each puzzle is associated with either a city with a Federal Reserve Bank, or a city in one of their regions.  (In the original puzzle, this association was made on the puzzle pages; here, the cluephrase specifically mentions a city.)  The Federal Reserve officially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank#Banks">associates letters with each region</a>.  The letter of the Federal Reserve District appears once in the answer for the corresponding city; use that as a letter location to index into the answer word for the other city in that region.
