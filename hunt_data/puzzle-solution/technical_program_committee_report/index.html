<h2>Solution to Technical Program Committee Report</h2>

<p>
<i>Authors: Anand Sarwate and Jason Juang</i><br>
<i>With much help from: Dan Katz, Chieu Nguyen, and Laura Royden</i><br>
<i>And a little help from: Erin Rhode</i>
</p>

<p>When teams register for the hunt they were sent an invitation to present a paper at the <i>33rd Annual Conference on Maturing Young Scientific Theories: Emerging Resolutions for Yielding Heuristic Unphysics using Noncomputation Techniques</i>, which is the dummy theme for the Hunt this year.  In the email they were asked to submit a paper title for presentation at the conference.</p>

<p>This puzzle uses the paper titles submitted by teams.  Solvers are given a list of clues; each clue consists of a paper title, a short (negative) review of the paper, and a score.  The review contains a bolded phrase which is an anagram of a word from the team's name and a word from their paper title, such that the pairing matches the team to a title.</p>

<p>The solvers must match each title to the corresponding team name. Taking the score of the review, indexing it into the team name, and reading in the order in which the reviews are presented yields the phrase MASTERPIECE OF AESTHETICS BY AYN RAND NAMED THE ROMANTIC BLANK.  Ayn Rand's "masterpiece" is <i>The Romantic Manifesto</i>, so the answer is MANIFESTO.</p>

<p>The list of clues in team order is given below.</p>
