<p>
The puzzle contains 5 audio files, each tracking the path of one of 5
characters who are at the Mad Hatter's Cocktail Party: the April Hare,
the Titmouse, the Butterfly, the Real Turtle, and Tweedledoo.  The
characters move between different rooms, sometimes meeting each other,
and sometimes soliloquizing on their own.  The <a
href="FullScript.html">script</a> was not made available to the
hunters, but may make the solution easier to parse.
</p>

<p>Solvers are supposed to realize the following facts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each of the audio files tracks a single character.</li>
<li>There are 9 distinct locations at the party.  This is clued by
descriptive dialogue plus the presence (or
absence) of certain other characters (e.g. a cheese-obsessed friend of
the host at the Buffet).</li>
<li>The locations are laid out in a 3x3 grid as a phone keypad.  This 
is clued by the characters referring to how different locations 
relate to each other.</li>
<li>The characters talk a lot about phones -- this clues the extraction
mechanism, namely phone spell.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In addition to the 5 characters for each track, there are a few
Non-Puzzle Characters (NPCs):</p>
<ul>
<li>Bob the Gecko</li>
<li>The Cheshire Dentist</li>
<li>The Caffeinated Cordwainer</li>
<li>The Gibbertalk</li>
<li>The Bartender</li>
<li>The Mad Hatter (who only shouts CHANGE PLACES at the end of each scene)</li>
</ul>

<p>The locations are as follows (numbers indicate keypad location:<br />
1 - Bar<br />
2 - Bathroom<br />
3 - Buffet<br />
4 - Closet<br />
5 - Living Room<br />
6 - Hallway<br />
7 - Library<br />
8 - Balcony<br />
9 - Foyer<br />
</p>

<p>The clues in the script (to deduce the layout) are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bob the Gecko is with the food (cheese)</li>
<li>there is a closet </li>
<li>the food is straight ahead of where the Cordwainer is </li>
<li>the bar is not next to the food </li>
<li>there is an outside location </li>
<li>there is a location with columns </li>
<li>Tweedledoo is between the Titmouse and food </li>
<li>there is a bathroom </li>
<li>the bar is next door to the closet </li>
<li>the bathroom is between the bar and the food </li>
<li>the closet is on the opposite side from where the Cordwainer is </li>
<li>there is a center of the party (and it is deserted) </li>
<li>you can see the balcony from the center </li>
<li>the center is between the bathroom and the balcony </li>
<li>the balcony faces south </li>
<li>there is a library </li>
<li>library is possibly in the other direction from the bar with respect to the closet </li>
<li>the bar is the #1 spot </li>
<li>the bar is maximally distant from the door </li>
<li>the bar is next to the bathroom </li>
<li>the hallway is a knight's jump from the library and the bar </li>
<li>the Butterfly didn't change locations </li>
<li>library is maximally distant from the buffet </li>
<li>the balcony is between the library and the door </li>
<li>the closet is between the library and the bar </li>
</ul>

<p>The character movements through the puzzle look like this, with
their corresponding phone spells, in order of the audio files in the
puzzle, yield:<br />
Track A (TITMOUSE): 92581111 => WALT<br />
Track B (APRIL HARE): 34763971 => DISNEYS<br />
Track C (TWEEDLEDOO): 62311111 => MAD<br />
Track D (BUTTERFLY): 42883711 => HATTER<br />
Track E (REAL TURTLE): 86423111 => VOICE<br />
</p>

<p>The answer is <b>ED WYNN</b>, who voiced the Mad Hatter in Disney's 1951 film, Alice in Wonderland.</p>
