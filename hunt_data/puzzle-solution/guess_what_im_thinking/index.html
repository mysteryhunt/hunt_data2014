<h2>Solution to Guess What I'm Thinking</h2>

<p><i>Authors: Chieu Nguyen and Aaron Bader</i></p>

<p>This puzzle is a parody of the puzzle authoring no-no of writing a puzzle
  that is essentially "guess what the author is thinking."  As such, the
  puzzle appears to be nothing but a line with 20 blank squares.  However, in order to
  assist the solver, the puzzle itself interacts with your guesses to guide
  you towards the correct answer.</p>

<p>In order to solve the puzzle you must attempt to submit an answer that is
  20 letters long.  Yes, you actually have to
  submit an answer.  Provided that your
  answer guess is 20 letters long (after excluding non-alphabetical characters),
  you will receive a response that shows you how to proceed.
  And no, this answer is not counted against you.
</p>

<p>Once you make a guess, you are presented with a response that indicates the
  difference between your guess and the string of letters we had in mind.
  You are also given four more rows of blanks ranging from 21 blanks to 24
  blanks, as well as an input box to use so that you don't accidentally call
  in guesses as answer attempts and make things a logistical nightmare for us.
  Any guess from 20 to 24 letters long will receive a response, and each length
  corresponds to a different guessing game.
   </p>

<p>The four correct solutions are:</p>
<ol>
<li><tt>WORDOFTENWITHNEITHER</tt> = NOR</li>
<li><tt>DIRECTIONOPPOSITEWEST</tt> = EAST</li>
<li><tt>CLOONEYHOSPITALNBCSHOW</tt> = ER</li>
<li><tt>JETSTARPACIFICSIATACODE</tt> = BL</li>
<li><tt>COMEDIANEDDIEOFTHERICHES</tt> = IZZARD</li>
</ol>

<p>The answers to the phrase combine to form the answer, <b>NOR'EASTER BLIZZARD</b>. Now, we know that you can probably guess the answer with 4 or maybe even 3 
  of the pieces.  But you guys were having so much fun with this puzzle, that
  you probably solved them all anyway.</p>

<p>Here's how all the different guessing games work:</p>

<p>For the 20-letter phrase, WORDOFTENWITHNEITHER, you are given the
  standard Mastermind readout.  Black means that you have a letter in the
  correct place.  White means you have a letter, but not in the correct
  place.</p>

<p>For the 21-letter phrase, DIRECTIONOPPOSITEWEST, the answer first compares
  the length of the Morse code strings.  If they are different lengths, it lets
  you know that your guess is not the correct length, and gives you a decimal
  value of how much longer or shorter you are.  If it is the same length, it
  tells you the binary difference between the answer you "tapped out" and the
  actual answer, treating dits as 0 and dahs as 1.  The "tapped out" is
  supposed to clue you towards Morse.  Eventually you get a solution that is
  the same length letterwise, and the same number of Morse characters, but
  this is still not enough for a unique phrase.  So in the case that the
  Morse strings are the same, it will tell you where your first error is.</p>

<p>For the 22-letter phrase, CLOONEYHOSPITALNBCSHOW, you are given 22 symbols.
  The symbol is red if your guess letter is earlier in the alphabet than the
  correct letter and blue if it is later in the alphabet than your guess
  letter.  It is green if it is correct.  This one is trivial to do with 26
  guesses, so feel free to thank us.</p>

<p>For the 23-letter phrase, JETSTARPACIFICSIATACODE, convert both the guess and
  the phrase into a 23-dimensional vector using standard alphanumeric
  substitution.  Then take the Euclidean 2-norm of the difference of the
  vectors.  This yields how far "off" you are from the answer phrase.</p>

<p>For the 24-letter phrase, COMEDIANEDDIEOFTHERICHES, you are given a set of
  slashes lines and dots in two sets.  The top set are the pigpen strokes that
  appear in your letter but not in the corresponding answer letter.  The
  bottom set are the ones that appear in the answer letter but not in your
  letter.</p>
