<h2>Solution to Captain's Log</h2>

<i>Authors: Brandy Buckingham and Robbie Buckingham</i>

<p>
<b>Summary:</b>
<ol>
<li> Solve the thirty Star Trek-themed cryptic clues.
<li> Note that the only answers that are either first or last names are WILLIAM, PATRICK, AVERY, KATE, and SCOTT. These are the first names of the five people who have played the primary captains in Star Trek TV shows (William Shatner, Patrick Stewart, Avery Brooks, Kate Mulgrew, and Scott Bakula).
<li> Enter one captain into each grid, starting at and in the direction of the arrow, putting each name in the grid whose given date corresponds to the date/stardate that the show starts in. (Grids are given in in-universe chronological order.)
<li> Enter the rest of the answers into the grids in chains, with first and last letters overlapping. The enumerations, overlaps, and five crosses per grid should be sufficient to uniquely place all of the words once the captains are in place.
<li> Taking the letters at the points and crosses of the stars in the order indicated by the numbers in these spots gives BEAM US WORF ELIM GARAK NOG OR ANOTHER RIDGED-TYPE TREK ALIEN. When teams provide us with a ridged Star Trek alien (in whatever form, though bringing us Michael Dorn >>> wearing a costume >> action figure >> picture), we give them the answer.
