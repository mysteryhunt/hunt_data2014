<p>Teams received a quantity of shredded paper.  Reconstructing the documents &ndash; hooray for frosh! &ndash; produces a series of images.  The images are all from <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/sriracha">The Oatmeal's Dear Sriracha</a> comic.</p>

<p>Most of the letters in the comic have been replaced with "X", except for a handful which have been replaced by a number from 1 to 33.  Take the numbered letters and place them in order to get RED JUICY COCK DISH RHYMES WITH COCO VAN.  The answer is <b>COQ AU VIN</b>.</p>

<p>For reference, the replaced words (in numerical order) are:</p>
