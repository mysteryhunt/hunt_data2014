<h2>Saturdy &amp; Sundy</h2>
<p><i>Authors: Quinn Mahoney and Ash Turza</i></p>
<p>
These are paraphrased lyrics from the three mixtapes released by The Weeknd in 2011: <i>House of Balloons</i>, <i>Thursday</i>, and <i>Echoes of Silence</i>.
(Released in 2012 as a compilation, <i>Trilogy</i>).
Match the fake lyrics to the real lyrics and notice one word has been changed by removing a letter.
Determine the missing letters and order them by mixtape and track number to get the phrase RITTZ ALIAS JONNY.
This gives the answer, VALIANT.
