<h2>Solution to SAT III</h2>
<i>Authors: Chieu Nguyen, Pranjal Vachaspati, and Cathy Wu</i>

<p>This puzzle is made to resemble a section of the SAT exam, but with difficult optimization problems instead. Each of the 9 problems is a classic NP-hard optimization problem that has an associated NP-complete decision problem. The first problem is MAX-3SAT, which has the classic 3SAT boolean satisfiability problem as an associated decision problem; this is what the title of the puzzle refers to.</p>
<p>Each problem has a unique integer solution which is not among the choices given. Mapping alphanumerically (A=1, etc.), the solutions spell out <b>KEEP GOING</b>, as a confirmation in case some of the problems were solved incorrectly.</p>
<p>As suggested by the example problem, and by the subtly ambiguous wording of the directions, the correct answer is to be calculated by combining the 5 answer choices with arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), following the conventional order of operations. In each case, there is a unique sequence of operations that combines with the answer choices to yield the correct answer. For example, for the first problem, the answers combine in the following way: 1&#215;5&#215;2+13&#8722;12=11.</p>
<p>Returning to the example problem, we see that all 5 of the example answer choices make a valid equation. In a similar manner, plug in the sequence of operations from each problem into the example equation, and solve the equation for the missing number on the right-hand side. These map alphanumerically (A=1, etc.) to spell out the answer to the puzzle: <b>MILLSTONE</b>.</p>
