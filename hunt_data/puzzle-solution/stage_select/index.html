<p>The puzzle is presented as a <i>Hollywood Squares</i>-style tic-tac-toe game. The trick is that the board positions correspond to the stage select screens from the original series <i>Mega Man</i> games. The names of the players, X and Zero, are an additional link to the Mega Man series; they are the protagonists of multiple spin-off series.

<p>Each set of questions below represents a different game: <i>Mega Man</i>s 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10, in order from top to bottom, left to right. These eight games are the entries in the series that feature the classic 3&times;3 stage select screen layout. One word in each question has been replaced with the word "robot". The replaced word is the name of a Robot Master (<i>sans</i> the "Man" or "Woman" suffix), or the word "Rock", representing Mega Man himself (whose original name was Rock) in the center square.</p>

<p>Find the answer to each question. Record the first letter of the answer, and whether X or Zero got the square, in the position in the grid corresponding to the robot's position on the stage select screen. Two examples are given to get you started. One "neutral" square is also given; that square ultimately ends up not belonging to either player.</p>

<p>Fill in the blank grid squares to complete the names of well-known fictional robots in the grid. These robots are represented:
<ul>
  <li>Starscream, from the <i>Transformers</i> series
  <li>GLaDOS, from the <i>Portal</i> series
  <li>Marvin, from the <i>Hitchhiker's Guide</i> series
  <li>Bender, from <i>Futurama</i>
  <li>Doraemon, of an eponymous manga series
  <li>Twiki, from <i>Buck Rogers in the 25th Century</i>
  <li><span title="CROOOOOOW!">Crow T. Robot, from <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000</i></span>
  <li>Tachikoma, from <i>Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</i>
  <li>H.E.L.P.eR, from <i>The Venture Bros.</i>
  <li>Clamps, also from <i>Futurama</i>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Finally, find the empty squares in each grid where X and Zero can complete a three-in-a-row. Read the letters in order from X's winning squares, then from Zero's winning squares, to find the answer, <b>ICE CREAM SANDWICH</b>, which is also the name of a version of Google's Android OS.</p>
