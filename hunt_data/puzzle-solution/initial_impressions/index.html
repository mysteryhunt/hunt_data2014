<h2>Solution to Initial Impressions</h2>

<i>Author: David Wilson</i><br/>

<p>Each phrase clues a person who is frequently referred to by two initials and a surname.  Furthermore, each clue contains an anagram of that person's name with one letter changed.  The original letters from the people's names read out HE WROTE OF ANIMALS.  By the same transform, ANIMALS becomes the answer: <b>AA MILNE</b>.</p>
