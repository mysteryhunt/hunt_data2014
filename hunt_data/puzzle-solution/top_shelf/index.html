<h2>Solution to Top Shelf</h2>

<p>
<i>Authors: Laura Martini, Kyle Buza</i>
</p>

<p>The solver receives a puzzle with two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>An image with 32 unique bourbon bottles lined up on a counter, with their
labels easily legible, and two empty shelves behind the counter.
<li>A set of 31 short narrative descriptions that contain two things: enough
information to uniquely identify one of the bottles (or, in a couple of cases,
two bottles from the same distiller), and enough information to determine a
number to use to index into the name of the bourbon. The format is a discussion
between a bartender and a customer.
</ol>

<p>How to solve:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the bottles on the shelf.
<li>Map each bottle to one narrative description. One company has two bottles in
the set (Sazerac), and both bottles share a single narrative description,
meaning that there are 31clue phrases for 32 bottles.
<li>Determine the proper name for the bourbon by using the enumeration written
below each bottle in the enlarged version of the image.  This version is
viewable by clicking on the row of bourbons in the original "thumbnail" image on
the main page of the photo.
<li>Extract the correct number from the description by taking the length, in
words, of the customer's response to the bartender's description.  Use this
number to index into the bourbon's name. This will give you a single letter.
<li>After performing this step, you will have the phrase:
"BASOMURUBGONWISTOUDMEMPOICSTRATO".
<li>Have the "aha" that you need to separate the bourbons into top shelf
(expensive) and bottom shelf (inexpensive) groups. This is clued by the name of
the puzzle being "Top Shelf."
<li>Determine whether the bourbon is a "top shelf" bourbon or a "bottom shelf"
bourbon.
<li>The top shelf bourbons spell: BOURBON IS TO DEMOCRAT and the bottom shelf
answers spell: AS MUGWUMP IS TO.
<li>Dust off your memory of American history, or Google to determine the answer:
<b>REPUBLICAN</b>.
