<h2>Solution to Opposites Are Not Downbeats</h2>

<p>

<p>Each clue is clearly broken into two parts, and the answers to these parts
  are two words.  The first word begins with letters usually indicating an
  opposition or negation.  The prefixes used are, "A," "AB," "DE," "DIS,"
  "IN," "IR," "MIS," "NON," and "UN."  Although in most cases these prefixes
  are not actually used in the context of negation, and often aren't prefixes
  at all.  The second word is clued by "not X" and these are the words that
  result when those prefixes are stripped.  For example, the first clue: "A
  Pok&#233mon is not an Egyptian god", "A Pok&#233mon" clues "abra" and
  "not an Egyptian god" clues "ab-ra."  The letter extracted from these
  answers is the R that begins "ra".</p>

<p>  Taking all the first letters yields a final clue phrase.  "RENOUNCES OR
  DENIES PLEASURE IS NOT THE ANSWER."  Googling the first part of the clue
  phrase should make it clear that the answer you're going for is ABNEGATES.
  Removing the ab prefix gives the answer <b>NEGATES</b>.</p>

<p>The title is a bonus clue, giving the words antitheses and anti-theses,
  with theses being a straight synonym for downbeats.  This clue was
  formulated given the stipulation that DOWN must appear in the title, and the
  creation of which is credited to Chieu Nguyen, who testsolved the
  proto-puzzle.</p>
