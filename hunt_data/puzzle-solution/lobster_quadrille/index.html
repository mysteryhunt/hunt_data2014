<h2>Solution to Lobster Quadrille</h2>

<i>Author: Anand Sarwate</i>

<p>In the Lobster Quadrille, teams showed up and were handed a stuffed or rubber lobster, a picture of a full lobster and each participant got a dance card corresponding to one of 5 parts of the lobster with 6 dances listed on it.  These corresponded to:

<ul>
<li><strong>mackerelena = macarena</strong>

<li><strong>crabnam style = gangnam style</strong>

<li><strong>damn it, clam it! = time warp</strong>

<li><strong>electric eel = electric slide</strong>

<li><strong>lobster dance = chicken dance</strong>

<li><strong>crawfish walk = bunny hop</strong>
</ul>

<p>Each card had a picture and label of a piece of the lobster (antennae, left claw, right claw, cephalothorax, abdomen).  The dancers formed groups of five comprising a full lobster and then learned the 6 dances on their card in front of the each of the 6 dance leaders.  When, as a lobster, they satisfied the dance leader, the leader took their dance cards and filled out 5 letters corresponding to that dance and the lobster part.


<p>When they completed all 6 dances, the teams assembled their lobster cards with the sheet for the full lobster that already has an E on the tail and read off the clue phrase:  WATCH OUT FOR THE WHITE KNIGHT'S BLADE.

<P><i>TODO: INSERT all the PDFs from the WIKI page with the diagrams of the lobsters.</i>
