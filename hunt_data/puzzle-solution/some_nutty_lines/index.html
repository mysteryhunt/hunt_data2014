<h2>Solution to Some Nutty Lines</h2>
<i>Authors: Aaron Bader and Harvey Jones</i>

<p>This puzzle has 9 dialogues from famous Saturday Night Live skits, arranged chronologically. The dialogues are ciphered in the following way, using part of the first skit as an example.</p>

<p>1) The alphabet is split with half the letters designated as "left-hand side" letters and the other half designated as "right-hand side" letters.</p>

<pre>
<b>Left-hand side       Right-hand side</b>
<span class="left">wxgtankvuoszj</span>        <span class="right">biremplqfhdyc</span>
</pre>

<p>2) Each word is rearranged, so that all the left hand letters are on the left side of the new word, and all the right hand letters are on the right side.</p>

<p>My brother and I are from Czechoslovakia</p>

<p>
<span class="right">My</span>
<span class="left">ot</span><span class="right">brher</span>
<span class="left">an</span><span class="right">d</span>
<span class="right">I</span>
<span class="left">a</span><span class="right">re</span>
<span class="left">o</span><span class="right">frm</span>
<span class="left">zosovaka</span><span class="right">Cechli</span>
</p>

<p>3) Each right hand side, and each left hand side letter are mapped to one of the letters in A-M.</p>

<pre>
<b>Left-hand side       Right-hand side</b>
<span class="left">wxgtankvuoszj</span>        <span class="right">biremplqfhdyc</span>
<span class="left">ABCDEFGHIJKLM</span>        <span class="right">ABCDEFGHIJKLM</span>

<span class="right">MY</span> <span class="left">OT</span><span class="right">BRHER</span> <span class="left">AN</span><span class="right">D</span> <span class="right">I</span> <span class="left">A</span><span class="right">RE</span> <span class="left">O</span><span class="right">FRM</span> <span class="left">ZOSOVAKA</span><span class="right">CECHLI</span>
<span class="right">EL</span> <span class="left">JD</span><span class="right">ACJDC</span> <span class="left">EF</span><span class="right">K</span> <span class="right">B</span> <span class="left">E</span><span class="right">CD</span> <span class="left">J</span><span class="right">ICE</span> <span class="left">LJKJHEGE</span><span class="right">MDMJGB</span>
</pre>

<p>4) A separator letter, taken from N-Z is placed in between the two halves.</p>

<pre>
<span class="right">EL</span> <span class="left">JD</span>Y<span class="right">ACJDC</span> <span class="left">EF</span>Y<span class="right">K</span> <span class="right">B</span> <span class="left">E</span>Y<span class="right">CD</span> <span class="left">J</span>Y<span class="right">ICE</span> <span class="left">LJKEHEGE</span>Y<span class="right">MDMJGB</span>
</pre>

<p>As a helpful hint, each encrypted paragraph is preceded by a short descriptive phrase in an intermediate step. The letters have been split between right and left, and the separator has been added in, but they have not been ciphered.  This gives clues as to whether some letters appear on the left or the right and should help determine the structure of the encryption.  It might also help identify the piece in question.

<p>In each dialogue, one of the words is replaced by ???? (or in one case, a five letter word, it is replaced by ?????). Each of these missing words maps to consecutive letters in the left-hand side letters for that dialogue. To solve the puzzle, you must figure out the right hand side letters that correspond to each of these words.</p>

<pre>
Missing word:          <span class="left">TANK</span>
Ciphered letters:      DEFG
Corresponding letters: <span class="right">EMPL</span>
</pre>

<p>Note that the separator letters are unique, spanning from R-Z inclusive. Arranging the corresponding letters in order of the separators:</p>

<pre>
Separator:               R    S    T     U    V    W    X    Y    Z
Missing word:          <span class="left">JUNK LICK AWFUL WHAT WORD KEPT DAWN TANK WRAP</span>
Ciphered letters:      ABCD EFGH IJKLM ABCD EFGH IJKL MABC DEFG HIJK
Corresponding letters: <span class="right">THIR TYRO CKEPI SODE FEAT URIN GMRT EMPL ETON</span>
</pre>

<p>This spells out the answer phrase, "THIRTY ROCK EPISODE FEATURING MR TEMPLETON", which is <b>FLU SHOT</b>.</p>

<p>Notes on punctuation:  All apostrophes have been moved to the end of the word.  Hyphens have been removed and the two words have been treated as separate words.  This was deemed to be the least confusing option for hyphenated words.  Punctuation that appears at the beginning or end of the word is preserved in the correct place.  This includes quotation marks, commas, periods, colons, question marks and exclamation points.

<p>My brother and I are from Czechoslovakia, even though no one can tell. We escaped during the seventy five riots, by throwing many rocks at a Russian ????(TANK). We ran from it to come to America, but, boy, we gave up many things. Back there, we have a nice, groovy apartment, three cars and a summer house, which the government now owns! Back there, we have medical degrees, but here in America we must be salesmen for decorative bathroom fixtures. There, we are brain surgeons!</p>
