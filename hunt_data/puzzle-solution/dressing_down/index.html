Each of the images is excerpted from a movie poster (and then, in most cases, rotated). The movie titles within
each image are in alphabetical order, row by row. These movies were all nominated for the Academy Award for Best 
Costume Design; in fact, half of them won that award, while the other half are nominees that lost to those winners.

For each year, one can take the winner and loser, and identify the directions in which the tops of these two images
point. These two directions form a semaphore letter. Reading these letters in order by year yields the phrase
HEMMING BIRTHSTONE (with one missing year indicating the space). Lindy Hemming won a costuming Oscar for the
film <i>Topsy-Turvy</i>; she was born in August, and her birthstone (in the modern American system) is the 
<b>PERIDOT</b>.
