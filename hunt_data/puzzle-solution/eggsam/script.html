<h2>Eggsam - Script for Eggsaminers</h2>
<p>
<i>Before administering the Eggsam, you should know the name of the team that has made 
an appointment. You should also have a copy of
the eggsam answer key handout, which you will give to the test-taker if they succeed,
and a certificate of failure, which you will give them if they fail.</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Greetings. I am Professor Dumpty. This is the final eggsam for my Advanced Vocabulary Course.
I sincerely hope you have been paying attention throughout the semester, as opposed to cramming and
trying to learn everything at the last minute. As a reminder, you may not use or take notes
during this eggsam.</b>
</p>

<p>
<i>(If there is more than one solver present from the team, that's against the rules, so say:)</i>
<br>
<b>As specified in the instructions, this eggsam may only be taken by one student at a time. So
I'm afraid all but one of you will have to leave the room before we begin.</b>
</p>

<p><b>Am I correct in my belief that you are a member of the team [TEAM NAME]?</b><br>
<i>(If they disagree with this, contact HQ and resolve the discrepancy.)</i></p>

<p><b>Is this your team's first time taking the eggsam?</b><br>
<i>(If they say yes, let N=0; if they say no:)</i><br>
<b>Do you have any certificates of failure to prove this?</b><br>
<i>(If they do, let N be the number of certificates they show you.)</i>

<p><b>Very good! You will be permitted [N+1] mistakes. If you make an [(N+2)th] mistake, the eggsam
will immediately end. Are you ready?</b></p> 

<p><i>Ask each question in the order below (be sure to give the question numbers, even though these numbers
are out of order). If they answer correctly, tell them they are correct and continue. If they give an incorrect
answer, tell them the correct answer and continue. If they make [N+2] mistakes, say:</i>
<br><b>I'm afraid you have failed in what I eggspected to be an eggsceedingly simple task. 
Here is a certificate of failure to commemorate your lack of achievement.
Please return to your homebase, review your notes, and make an appointment to attempt the eggsam again later.
When you return, bring any certificates of failure you have accumulated, as we
will allow you to make more mistakes next time.
