Rearranging these by question number and reading the first letters
gives the phrase "SKIRT CAVIAR PORTMANTEAU." The definitions given
for SKIRT and CAVIAR actually define the words "Pensacola" and
"forgiveness." A portmanteau (a word coined by Humpty Dumpty) is
a new word formed by combining parts of two words; applying this
process to "Pensacola" and "forgiveness" gives the puzzle answer,
<b>PENSIVENESS</b>.
