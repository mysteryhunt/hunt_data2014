<h2>Common Bonds</h2>

Although this looks like a word search, searching turns up very few words. 
However, there are some noteworthy words in the sixth and twelfth
rows and columns; in fact, there are nine words which can fill those rows
and columns with no intersection or overlap. These words also
conspicuously start with the nine letters A through I, giving them
a natural ordering.
<p>
Circling these words divides the rest of the grid into nine 5x5 grids,
and the presence of the nine words, plus the 3x3 matrix of tuples below
the grid, hopefully hint that these grids
each need to be dealt with separately. (In addition, each of them 
has an S in the
lower-right corner, further cluing they have something in common.) 
<p>
While no long words can be found in these grids as word searches, each 
grid has several words hidden Boggle-style, moving left, right, up, and
down, with no overlaps between words. There are some unintended words
that can be found, but each correct set has something in common; all 
the members form compound words when placed before the same noun. The 
enumerations of the words in each box are given in the matrix.
<p>
Furthermore, the unused letters spell the plural of this noun, apart
from one extraneous letter. For example, in the first grid, one can
find BASE, CANNON, FOOT, and SCREW, all of which form words when BALL
is added. The unused letters spell BWALLS, BALLS with an extra W. The
grids are alphabetized by category.

<ul>
<li>B(W)ALLS: BASEball, CANNONball, FOOTball, SCREWball
<li>B(E)OARDS: CHALKboard, CLIPboard, SURFboard, WHITEboard
<li>BO(A)OKS: CHECKbook, HANDbook, POCKETbook, YEARbook
<li>CAST(R)S: BROADcast, DOWNcast, SPORTScast, TYPEcast
<li>DO(M)GS: BULLdog, FIREdog, HANGdog, LAPdog, UNDERdog
<li>GLAS(H)SES: FIBERglass, HOURglass, SANDglass, WINEglass
<li>HO(P)RSES: CLOTHEShorse, RACEhorse, SEAhorse, WORKhorse
<li>MARK(A)S: BENCHmark, BIRTHmark, POSTmark, TRADEmark
<li>STI(D)CKS: BROOMstick, CANDLEstick, CHOPstick, LIPstick
</ul>
<p>
Each of the categories can be associated with one of the nine original
words, giving an ordering for the extra letters:
<ul>
<li>ARAB = HORSES = P
<li>BIBLIOPHILE = BOOKS = A
<li>CANES = STICKS = D
<li>DRINK = GLASSES = H
<li>EMERY = BOARDS = E
<li>FRANKFURTER = DOGS = M
<li>GLOBE = BALLS = W
<li>HIGHLIGHTER = MARKS = A
<li>INJURED = CASTS = R
</ul>

This spells three words, PAD, HEM, and WAR, that can all precede LOCK
in compound words. Thus, pluralizing as in all the other categories,
the answer is <b>LOCKS</b>. (This answer is title-appropriate, since
LOCKS are common examples of bonds. Credit to Aaron Bader for noticing
the availability of good ____LOCK words and thus inspiring this puzzle.)
