<h2>Solution to Callooh Callay, World!</h2>
<i>Author: James Clark</i>

<p>
This is a program written in Wonderlang, a silly language.  The challenge
is to run it.  To do so, solvers must reverse engineer the
mechanics of the language and the meanings of the symbols and
identifiers.

<p>
Figuring those things out should require only analyzing the
"include" files (burble, chortle, deficious, grabe, and slithy).
Each of those defines one or two small functions
which should be recognizable once the basics of the language
are gleaned, and each helps to confirm some of the trickier
parts of the language.

<p>
Once those are resolved, the final task is to evaluate the
runme file.  This is possible either by analyzing it
in parts and porting it to another language, or by writing
an interpreter for Wonderlang and running the program
directly.

<h3>The Basics</h3>

This is a stack-oriented language which uses postfix notation.
For the most part, each token pushes a value onto the stack, but some
reserved symbols and identifiers perform other operations.  In addition
to the stack, values can be stored in scoped variables.  '&#x2039;' and
'&#x203A;' are used to push the names of variables (as opposed to the
values) onto the stack.  '&#x00AB;' and '&#x00BB;' denote blocks of
code, which are pushed onto the stack as well.  The number system is
base 14, using the digits 0A23456789TJQK.  Arrays are zero-indexed.
Reserved identifiers are rendered in italics to help distinguish them
from variable names.

<p>
Here are some example expressions and their meanings:

<h3>slithy.wl</h3>

<p>
This is a recursive algorithm for computing the Nth fibonacci
number.

<h3>grabe.wl</h3>

<p>
This is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">
the Euclidian algorithm</a> for computing the greatest common
divisor.

<h3>deficious.wl</h3>

<p>
This is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">
linear congruential generator</a> using the formula:
<pre>
  X[n+1] = (10001 * X[n] + 12345) mod 65536
</pre>

<h3>chortle.wl</h3>

<p>
This implements a looping mechanism.  It pops two "arguments",
a code block B and a number N.  It first calls B with N-1 (that is,
N-1 will be the top value of the stack
when B is called).  Then it calls B again with N-2, then
again with N-3, and so on until finally calling B with 0.

<h3>burble.wl</h3>

<p>
This is an implementation of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">quicksort</a>.
It pops an array of numbers and pushes a sorted version of
that array.

<h3>runme.wl</h3>

This is a set of functions that generate the answer phrase from
a hard-coded array of "ciphertext".  It is designed so that it
is possible to see the lengths of the words in the phrase in
advance, and so each word of the answer phrase requires a little
more to be figured out.  The idea being that if the solver
is porting the code and introduces a bug, they should have only
a limited piece of code to debug.

<p>
Here are explanations for the variable names:
<table>
<tr><td><b>Variable</b><td><b>Purpose</b>
<tr><td>jabberwock<td>The data array which is manipulated to produce the answer phrase
<tr><td>sword<td>An array of pseudo-randomly-generated numbers, used by frolick to shift the jabberwock data
<tr><td>muchness<td>Sums all the elements of an array, used to help check progress
<tr><td>snack<td>Function that produces the words of the answer phrase, by taking the first N values off the jabberwock array and pushing them onto the stack as an array
<tr><td>tweedle<td>Reverses the jabberwock array
<tr><td>frolick<td>Shifts each number in the jabberwock array by a corresponding entry in the sword array, using modulo to keep every element in the range 1-26
<tr><td>modge<td>"Unzips" the jabberwock array, moving every odd element to the first half and every even element to the second half
<tr><td>priot<td>Starting at the end, in-place, subtracts from each element the element before it, and then adds 26 if the result is less than one
</table>

<p>
The jabberwock array starts:
<pre>
[20, 8, 5, 3, 25, 18, 16, 5, 5, 10, 17, 19, 24, 24, 5, 5, 11, 4, 9, 25, 2]
</pre>

<p>
The sword array is:
<pre>
[233, 4461, 7992, 9223, 16764, 21775, 22004, 22885, 24890, 31507, 33518, 39171, 42416, 48818, 51953, 52844, 62326, 63499]
</pre>

<p>
First the jabberwock array is summed (using the muchness function).  If the sum is not 260, the program returns [5, 18, 18, 15, 18] ("ERROR").   Then the sword array is summed.  If the sum is not 556279, the program returns ERROR.  These checks are to help check mistakes in those arrays.

<p>
The first three numbers are pulled:
<pre>
[20, 8, 5] -> 'THE'
</pre>

<p>
The remainder is then reversed (tweedled), and then shifted by the values in the sword array (frolicked):
<pre>
tweedled: [2, 25, 9, 4, 11, 5, 5, 24, 24, 19, 17, 10, 5, 5, 16, 18, 25, 3]
frolicked: [1, 14, 19, 23, 5, 18, 13, 3, 6, 14, 21, 25, 15, 21, 21, 4, 3, 10]
</pre>

<p>
The first six numbers are pulled:
<pre>
[1, 14, 19, 23, 5, 18] -> 'ANSWER'
</pre>

<p>
The remainder is tweedled, then "unzipped" (modged), and then frolicked:
<pre>
tweedled: [10, 3, 4, 21, 21, 15, 25, 21, 14, 6, 3, 13]
modged: [10, 4, 21, 25, 14, 3, 3, 21, 15, 21, 6, 13]
frolicked: [9, 19, 5, 18, 8, 16, 11, 26, 23, 16, 10, 2]
</pre>

<p>
The first two numbers are pulled:
<pre>
[9, 19] -> 'IS'
</pre>

<p>
The remainder is tweedled, modged, prioted, and frolicked, and all ten numbers are pulled revealing the answer:
<pre>
tweedled: [2, 10, 16, 23, 26, 11, 16, 8, 18, 5]
modged: [2, 16, 26, 16, 18, 10, 23, 11, 8, 5]
prioted: [2, 14, 10, 16, 2, 18, 13, 14, 23, 23]
frolicked: [1, 5, 20, 9, 22, 5, 21, 19, 5, 18] -> '<b>ACTIVEUSER</b>'
