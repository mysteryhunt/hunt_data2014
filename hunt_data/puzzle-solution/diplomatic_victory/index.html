<h2>Solution to Diplomatic Victory</h2>
<i>Authors: Joel Miller and Aaron Bader</i>

<p>This is a game of Diplomacy from the point of view of Austria.  The first task is to match up the correspondances with the given years, using the requirement that no-one ever lies about capabilities.  If a country says they will move from a specific province, they will always at least have the capability of doing that.  If they say something happened in the past, it did.  This is in-line with a standard game of Diplomacy where all the moves are visible to everyone after each turn.  Whether they actually follow through on their promises is another question, and the point of the puzzle.</p>

<p>Using the maps it is possible to determine on each move whether the player writing the correspondence followed through or lied.  In the case of possibile ambiguities, these are cleared up in future correspondences.  There is always at least one blatant lie, or one obvious truth in each correspondence about a planned move.  Furthermore there is never both an obvious truth and a blatant lie in the same correspondence.  Using standard logic where 0 = False and 1 = True, a binary value can be assigned to each move, depending on which nations lied, and which nations told the truth.  The ordering is that given in the correspondence, with Britain (leader begins with A) being the most significant bit and Germany (leader begins with F) being the least.  Because only five bits are necessary to cover the English Alphabet, Britain always lies.</p>

<p>Taking these binary values and converting to alphanumerics spells out ARCHDUKE OTTO, a ruler of Austria around the era that the game of Diplomacy is set in.</p>

<p>Logic for the correspondences:

<p>Correspondence 1: There is only one move where the black sea is empty, and both Russia and Turkey can enter it, Spr '01</p>

<p>Correspondence 2: Russia can capture an empty Ankara only in Fall '05 and Spr '06, only in Spr '06 is there a posibility of Turkey convoying on British ships: Spr '06</p>

<p>Correspondence 3: The Germans are in Belgium only in Spr '02</p>

<p>Correspondence 4: There is only one move where Austria tried to enter Tyrolia, this is the move after that, Fall '01</p>

<p>Correspondence 5: There is only one move where Britain is capable of convoying an army out of Germany, Fall '03</p>

<p>Correspondence 6: The British are in Galicia only in Spr '05</p>

<p>Correspondence 7: There is only one move where Turkey has troops in Galicia, and Russia has troops in Rumania, Spr '04</p>

<p>Correspondence 8: There is only one move where Turkey has troops in both Smyrna and Ukraine, Fall '05</p>

<p>Correspondence 9: There is only one move where Turkey has a fleet in the Ionian and Russia has an army adjacent to Vienna, Fall '04</p>

<p>Correspondence 10: Italy is in the Ionian in Fall '01 and Fall '02, but only one of them can a Turkish fleet move to Armenia, Fall '02</p>

<p>Correspondence 11: Russia in Galicia and France in Burgundy only occurs in Spring '03</p>

<p>Correspondence 12: Germans in Tyrolia and France in Picardy only occurs in Fall '06</p>
