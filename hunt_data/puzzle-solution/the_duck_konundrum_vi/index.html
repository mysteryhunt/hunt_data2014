shows the contents of each pot and the chefs'
cutting boards after every step. When the kitchen is shut down, the numbers
of tablespoons of pepper in the pots, starting at Dude's pot and moving
counterclockwise, are 7, 12, 21, 20, 5, 14, 6, 18, 5, and 5. Reading these
as alphanumerics gives the puzzle answer, <b>GLUTEN FREE</b>.

Notes on a few easter eggs: The chefs, if it wasn't blatantly obvious, are
parodies of television chefs Guy Fieri, Emeril Lagasse, Gordon Ramsay,
Alton Brown, and Paula Deen. The Meat Munch is a tribute to the dish of the
same name offered at Friedey's in James Ernest's <i>Lord of the Fries</i>.
Zyzzlvaria is the setting of the non-award-winning non-best-selling
board game </i>Escape From Zyzzlvaria</i>, and it was also the setting for
the 2009 Mystery Hunt. And the names of the actions in Phase 4 are all
blender settings; this "coincidence" is intended to reassure solvers that
they're on the right track.
