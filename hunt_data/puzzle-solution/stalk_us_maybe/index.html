This is, in fact, an internet stalking puzzle. You're given a selection of members of Alice Shrugged, complete with pictures, graduation years, hometowns, and fun facts with enumerations after them.
<br><br>Once you begin to read about these people, you'll soon discover that the name matches the picture and graduation year, but that the hometowns are wrong and the fun facts are partially incorrect. Each fun fact can be corrected by replacing part of the fact with a phrase that matches the given enumerations.
