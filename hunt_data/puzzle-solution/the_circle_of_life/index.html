<p>
Thirty cartoon characters are presented, each from a Disney animated feature film. There are fifteen on each side of the page, with dots next to them.  In the middle are empty letter chains.
</p>

<p>
It was common for voice actors to fill many different roles for a
studio. Fifteen actors are represented here, and their names fit uniquely into
the chains.  Each actor voices one character from the left column and one from
the right column.
