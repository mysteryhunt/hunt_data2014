This puzzle involves both the logic puzzle trademarked in the US as KenKen (known in the
public domain as calcudoku or occasionally TomTom) and professional wrestling. Ken Kennedy,
a former WWE wrestler, provides the link between these concepts but is otherwise irrelevant
to the puzzle.
<p>
Each of the "Let me tell you something" snippets is an imagined interview with a pro
wrestler building up their match at the pay-per-view event SummerSlam. There have been 
twenty-six SummerSlam events as of January 2014, and each snippet is from a different event,
creating a correspondence between the numbers from 1 to 26 and the letters of the alphabet.

When each capital letter in a puzzle grid is replaced by its corresponding number, the grids
become uniquely solvable. The rules are that each row and column must contain the digits 1
to 6, and in each "cage," applying the given mathematical operation should result in the 
given number. (Note that in a cage with more than three blocks, subtraction and
division are cumulative; the larger number is divided by or reduced by all the smaller numbers
in turn. Also, the lowercase letters are ignored while solving.) The solutions are below:
<p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="sol1.png" width=400 style="padding:10px;">
<img src="sol2.png" width=400 style="padding:10px;">
<img src="sol3.png" width=400 style="padding:10px;">
<img src="sol4.png" width=400 style="padding:10px;">
</div>
<p>
Once the grids are solved, each lowercase-letter square has a number in it, as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>a = 3
<li>b = 4
<li>c = 4
<li>d = 2
<li>e = 3
<li>f = 5
<li>g = 3
<li>h = 5
<li>i = 3
<li>j = 2
<li>k = 6
<li>l = 2
<li>m = 4
<li>n = 1
<li>o = 3
<li>p = 2
<li>q = 5
<li>r = 4
</ul>
<p>
These numbers can be inserted into the sums at the bottom of the puzzle. They yield numbers between
1 and 26 that can then be converted into capital letters using the code above to spell <b>CUT PROMO AT HQ</b>.
<p>
<ul>
<li>b + h + m = 13 = C
<li>d + n + p = 5 = U
<li>a + f + m = 12 = T
<li>g + j + q = 10 = P
<li>d + i + p = 7 = R
<li>c + h + l = 11 = O
<li>e + j + n = 6 = M
<li>b + i + r = 11 = O
<li>c + k + r = 14 = A
<li>g + k + o = 12 = T
<li>a + e + o = 9 = H
<li>f + k + q = 16 = Q
</ul>
<p>
In pro wrestling lingo, to "cut a promo" means to give an interview hyping up a future match (as in the
interview segments in this puzzle). Teams must call HQ and make an appointment to cut their own promo;
when we do so, they are given the puzzle answer. <i>[Note: This puzzle was written as a backup, so it is
designed to replace any puzzle as necessary, since any answer can be given to the team after they cut
a promo.]</i>
