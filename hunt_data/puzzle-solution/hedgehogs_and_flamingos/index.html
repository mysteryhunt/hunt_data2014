<h2>SOLUTION: Hedgehogs and Flamingos</h2>

<i>Author: Jason Juang</i>

<img src="croquet-solved.png">

<p>The grid represents a croquet field. The title is an allusion to the
equipment used by the Queen of Hearts in her croquet game, as well as (sort of)
a reference to Mike Selinker's "Hedgehogs and Worms" puzzles.</p>

<p>A ball may score up to 13 points in croquet by passing through the hoops in
the correct order (and direction) and then striking the center peg, as
illustrated in the diagram. Each hoop is marked by a square that is split
diagonally into two halves. Words are clued in order, and must be entered in the
grid following the path that a ball would take around the field. Each hoop
square holds two letters; a different letter is used each time the ball passes
through the hoop.</p>

<p>Reading the 13 "scoring" letters&mdash;the 12 hoop letters in the order they
are used, plus the center peg&mdash;spells <b>CHRYSANTHEMUM</b>, which is the
answer.</p>
