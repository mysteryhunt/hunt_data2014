  <h2>Solution to Wandering Stars</h2>
  <i>Author: Josh Dillon</i>

  <p>In this puzzle, Hermes (the messanger god) describes a code using historical events, each of which can be pinpointed to a single day.  As hinted by the title "wandering stars" (which is the etymology for the word planet), each event is associated with two gods who are also planets.  Hermes hints that "where they reside" is important: it's the positions of the planets on the historical days that yield one letter in semaphore.  This <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/Solar">site</a> is very useful for the calculation of planet positions.  An example is given to removes the abiguity as to the orientation of the solar system (we choose the vernal equinox to be up and the sun to be viewed looking down on its north pole, which seems fairly natural):
<i><blockquote>
<i>Take, for example, the moment when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planted that American flag on the moon.  You might have seen the clear influence of both the god of love and the god of war in that moment, but I am sure you did not comprehend the message they were sending you all the way from where they reside.</i>
</blockquote></i>
The American flag was planted on the moon at 4:41 UTC on July 21, 1969 (though the exact time is unimportant).  The gods involved are Venus and Mars.

The fact that the clue is about both space and a flag are also hints.

To clarify the references to planets, only one aspect of each Roman god is used:
<ul>
<li>Mercury: Travellers</li>
<li>Venus: Love</li>
<li>Mars: War</li>
<li>Jupiter: Thunder</li>
<li>Saturn: Time</li>
<li>Uranus: The Sky</li>
<li>Neptune: The Sea</li>
</ul>
Also, each pair of gods is given in order from the sun.

<p>Taking the clued letters in the presented order gives "BAND OF TIME FOUND SEVENTH." Since time is the aspect of Saturn in the puzzle, the phrase hints the seventh ring of Saturn discovered.  The rings are named in order of their discovery, the seventh ring is the G Ring.  Therefore, the solution is <b>G RING</b>.
