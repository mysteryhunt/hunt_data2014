<p>People play Cards Against Wonderland, a game in the vein of Cards Against Humanity. The King of Hearts, apologetic, slightly bubbly, and somewhat easily confused, plays host. He apologizes for all the demands his compatriots have been making, and wants to provide everyone with a fun break.</p>

<p>After a certain amount of time (likely 45 minutes of play, with a table change halfway through, though they may stay until the end of the deck if they like), the King of Hearts gives them an answer phrase, which is "<b>A DORMOUSE, CATERPILLAR, OR RABBIT MAY DIG GARDEN HOLES.</b>"</p>
