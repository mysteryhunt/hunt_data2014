<h2>Solution to The Puzzle Your Puzzle Could Smell Like</h2>
<i>Author: Dan Katz</i><br>
<i>Acting by Usman Akeju</i>

<p>This puzzle consists of twelve videos (starring Usman Akeju) that parody Isaiah Mustafa's Old Spice video responses to Twitter questions, which can be found at
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL484F058C3EAF7FA6">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL484F058C3EAF7FA6</a>.

Each parody video has Isaiah responding to a different fictional Twitter handle, and the video ends with a caption (an enumeration and a timestamp) that is displayed while a variation on the Old Spice jingle (with the last note changed) plays.
<p>
The solver must:
<ol>
<li>Anagram each fictional Twitter handle in the video given in the puzzle (henceforth known as the "parody video") to get a real Twitter user to whom Isaiah posted a video (henceforth known as the "real video"), found online.</li>
<li>Find two pairs of phrases, one of which is the other anagrammed with an additional letter:</li>
<ul>
<li>The longer phrase is a two-word phrase that appears in the real video; the timestamp is given at the end of the parody video.</li>
<li>The shorter phrase is clued by the response in the parody video; the enumeration of this phrase is given at the end of the parody video.</li>
</ul>
<li>Order the extra letters by the incorrect jingle notes (which form a chromatic scale rising from D&sharp; to D) to get the answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The table below shows all the relevant information for each video; ordering the extra letters by musical note gives the answer <b>TESTOSTERONE</b>.
