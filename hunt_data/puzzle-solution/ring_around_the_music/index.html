<h2>Solution to Ring Around the Music</h2>

<p>
<i>Author: Robert L. Rucinski</i>
</p>

<p>In this puzzle, you are presented with staves of circular music filled with differently pitched notes of different note lengths.  There are 7 treble clef staves and 7 bass clef staves.</p>

<p>To solve the puzzle, overlap all of the treble clef staves into one treble clef stave.  Do the same for with the bass clef staves.  Connect notes (ala connect-the-dots style) of the same note letter (A, B, etc.) in any octave, within each staff, in order from whole note &rarr; half note &rarr; etc. &rarr; 128<sup>th</sup> note.  Each note letter (A) will spell out a clue letter.  Read the letters around the circle starting with the clef sign at the bottom.  The treble clef gives EEGLLN and the bass clef gives AABKLN&#9733;.</p>

<p>Then, arrange the clue letters for each clef in note letter order (A through G) to get the clue phrase: LENGLE BLANK A &#9733;.</p>

<p>The final answer is <b>TROUBLING</b>, as it completes the title of Madeleine L'Engle's novel <i>Troubling a Star</i>.</p>

<p>NOTE: Letters are separated out for clarity.  Because of overlap in notes, some original notes are obscured or the stems reversed.  This does not affect the solution.</p>
