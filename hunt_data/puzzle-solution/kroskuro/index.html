In a standard crossword the grid square with the number N is the 
Nth square, reading left-to-right and top-to-bottom, that is the 
start of a word (either across, down, or both).  In this variant, 
answer words of the same length and direction are numbered sequentially 
starting with 1, but are not placed in the grid in a particular order.  
Furthermore, the numbers which belong in the first square of each 
word are not given.  However, the sum of these missing numbers is given 
kakuro-style at the start of each row or column that should have two 
or more missing numbers.  <br>
