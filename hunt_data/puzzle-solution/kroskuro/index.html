<p>In a standard crossword the grid square with the number N is the 
Nth square, reading left-to-right and top-to-bottom, that is the 
start of a word (either across, down, or both).  In this variant, 
answer words of the same length and direction are numbered sequentially 
starting with 1, but are not placed in the grid in a particular order.  
Furthermore, the numbers that belong in the first square of each 
word are not given.  However, the sum of these missing numbers is given 
kakuro-style at the start of each row or column that should have two 
or more missing numbers.</p>

<p>Each of these clues the word ELEMENTS.  To extract the answer, take 
each letter in the grid with an accompanying number such that the 
letter and number form a valid atomic symbol / atomic mass pair.  
Reading these left-to-right and top-to-bottom yields</p>

<p><b>HOBO BOBO</b>,</p>

<p>the name of a 1947 Merrie Melodies cartoon about an Indian elephant 
voiced by Mel Blanc who manages to come to the United States as a 
stowaway.</p>
