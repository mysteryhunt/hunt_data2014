<h2>Solution to A Curious INCIDENCE</h2>

<p>
<i>Author: Alina Griner</i>

<div>

All of the clues are paraphrased quotes from <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>. The punctuation is kept the same but words/phrases in the sentence are replaced by synonymous words/phrases. Each clue is missing one word from the original phrase. The first step is to find the missing words.

<p>The second step is to notice that all of the missing words, if written in capital letters just as the clues, fit the same pattern: every letter in the word has the same symmetry type except one.</p>

Symmetry types (letters in multiple categories in parentheses):
<ul>
<li><span class="sym">BCDEK(HIOX)</span> &minus; reflectional symmetry about the horizontal axis<br>
<li><span class="sym">AMTUVWY(HIOX)</span> &minus; reflectional symmetry about the vertical axis<br>
<li><span class="sym">NSZ(HIOX)</span> &minus; reflectional symmetry about the origin<br>
<li><span class="sym">FGJLPQR</span> &minus; no symmetry<br>
</ul>

<p>For each group, taking the odd letter out from each missing word and reading these letters in order spells another word. Repeating this process with the new words, one for each group, spells out "<b>UTENSIL</b>". This is the answer to the puzzle.</p>

as the Tiger-lily only went on waving about, she spoke again, in a *TIMID* voice &minus;<br>
SINCE THE NATIVE AMERICAN PRINCESS JUST CONTINUED FLUTTERING AROUND, SHE COMMUNICATED ONCE MORE, IN AN ALTO &minus;<br>
<br>
Where the *NOISE* came from, she couldn't make out:  the air seemed full of it,<br>
THE LOCATION THE APPEARED FROM, THE PROTAGONIST FAILED AT DISCERNING: THE ATMOSPHERE HINTED AT BEING COMPLETE WITH IT,<br>
<br>
they were *ABOUT* the same size as the people, and quite seemed to fill the carriage.<br>
THEY WERE THE EXACT MAGNITUDE OF THE HUMANS, AND DEFINITELY APPEARED TO STUFF THE TRANSPORT.<br>
<br>
She was far too much *EXCITED* to be surprised at anything NOW.<br>
THE HERO WAS SIGNIFICANTLY OVERLY GREATLY TO BE AMAZED AT SOMETHING CURRENTLY.<br>

turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns *ROLL* over and begin kicking:<br>
ROTATE THE CHARACTER'S CRANIUM EXACTLY AT THE RIGHT MOMENT TO WITNESS A MEMBER OF THE FAIR PIECES TO THE OTHER SIDE AND START PUNTING:<br>
<br>
the path gave a sudden *TWIST* and shook itself (as she described it afterwards),<br>
THE DIRECTION PERFORMED AN UNEXPECTED AND DISTURBED ITSELF (AS SHE LABELED IT LATER),<br>
<br>
Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to *IMITATE*:<br>

Can you do Division?  *DIVIDE* a loaf by a knife &minus; what's the answer to that?<br>
ARE YOU ABLE TO PERFORM DISTRIBUTION? A BUN BY AN EDGE &minus; WHAT IS THE SOLUTION FOR THIS?<br>
<br>
Consider what a great *GIRL* you are.  Consider what a long way you've come to-day.<br>
THINK ABOUT WHAT A WONDERFUL YOU ARE. THINK ABOUT WHAT A FAR DISTANCE YOU HAVE TRAVELED THIS DAY.<br>
<br>
'Well, yes, if you call that a-dressing,' The Queen said.  'It isn't MY *NOTION* of the thing, at all.'<br>
'I GUESS, TRUE, IF YOU CONSIDER THAT A-GOWNING,' THE ROCK BAND SAID. 'IT IS NOT MY OF IT, IN ANY WAY.'<br>
<br>
she didn't feel a bit surprised at finding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close to her, one on *EACH* side:<br>
THE CHILD DID NOT HAVE THE EMOTION OF THE SLIGHTEST AMAZEMENT AT LOCATING THE ZINFANDEL MONARCH AND THE CHARDONNAY MONARCH SEATED NEAR HER, A MONARCH ON BORDER:<br>
<br>
I wonder what'll *BECOME* of MY name when I go in?<br>
I'M CURIOUS WHAT WILL WITH MY BRAND WHEN I ENTER?<br>
<br>
Then *FILL* up the glasses as quick as you can,<br>
THEREFORE TO THE BRIM THE MIRRORS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,<br>
<br>
I'm sure the woods look sleepy in the *AUTUMN*, when the leaves are getting brown.<br>
I AM CERTAIN THE FOREST APPEARS DROWSY IN THE, AS THE PAGES ARE BECOMING CHESTNUT.<br>

"OH TFL CARDS, ARRIVE AND TAKE A PROMENADE WITH MYSELF AND MY FRIEND!" THE LARGE MARINE ANIMAL DID.<br>

Alice *THOUGHT*, but nothing came of it.  'Please, would you tell me what YOU call yourself?'<br>
SHE, HOWEVER ZILCH MATERIALIZED FROM IT. 'LIKE, COULD YOU DISCLOSE TO ME THAT WHICH YOU NAME YOURSELF?'<br>
<br>
You're holding it all *CROOKED*!<br>
YOU ARE GRASPING IT COMPLETELY!<br>

'Oh, you *WICKED* little thing!' cried Alice, catching up the kitten,<br>
'AH, YOU TINY ITEM!' SCREAMED THE GIRL, ATTAINING THE MAMMAL,<br>
<br>
But I wish it wouldn't *FLAP* its wings so &minus; it make quite a hurricane in the wood &minus;<br>
THOUGH I DREAM IT WOULD NOT ITS APPENDAGES LIKE THIS &minus; IT CREATES SUCH A TWISTER IN THE TREES &minus;<br>
<br>
and he was going on, when his *EYE* happened to fall upon Alice:<br>
IN ADDITION HE WAS CONTINUING, AT WHICH POINT HIS CAME TO DROP ON THE FEMALE:<br>
<br>
you pulled Snowdrop away by the *TAIL* just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her!<br>
YOU GRAVITATED FLAKE OFF BY HER EXACTLY AS I HAD PLACED ON THE GROUND THE PLATE OF DAIRY IN FRONT OF HER!<br>
<br>
'And some eggs are very pretty, you know', she *ADDED*, hoping to turn her remark into a sort of a compliment.<br>
'ALSO A SUBSET OF OVULES ARE REALLY BEAUTIFUL, YOU UNDERSTAND,' SHE, ASPIRING TO TWIST HER STATEMENT INTO A VARIETY OF PRAISE.<br>
<br>
I sent to them again to say "It will be better to *OBEY*."<br>
I ADDRESSED TO THEM ONCE MORE TO ANNOUNCE "IT SHALL BE IMPROVED TO."<br>
