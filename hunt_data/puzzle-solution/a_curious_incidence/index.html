<h2>Solution to A Curious INCIDENCE</h2>

<p>

<div>

All of the clues are paraphrased quotes from <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>. The punctuation is kept the same but words/phrases in the sentence are replaced by synonymous words/phrases. Each clue is missing one word from the original phrase. The first step is to find the missing words.

<p>The second step is to notice that all of the missing words, if written in capital letters just as the clues, fit the same pattern: every letter in the word has the same symmetry type except one.</p>

Symmetry types (letters in multiple categories in parentheses):<br><br>
BCDEK(HIOX) &minus; reflectional symmetry about the horizontal axis<br>
AMTUVWY(HIOX) &minus; reflectional symmetry about the vertical axis<br>
NSZ(HIOX) &minus; reflectional symmetry about the origin<br>
FGJLPQR &minus; no symmetry<br>
<br>
For each group, taking the odd letter out from each missing word and reading these letters in order spells another word. Repeating this process with the new words, one for each group, spells out "<b>UTENSIL</b>". This is the answer to the puzzle.

THEY WERE THE EXACT MAGNITUDE OF THE HUMANS, AND DEFINITELY APPEARED TO STUFF THE TRANSPORT.<br>

the path gave a sudden *TWIST* and shook itself (as she described it afterwards),<br>

'Well, yes, if you call that a-dressing,' The Queen said.  'It isn't MY *NOTION* of the thing, at all.'<br>
'I GUESS, TRUE, IF YOU CONSIDER THAT A-GOWNING,' THE ROCK BAND SAID. 'IT IS NOT MY OF IT, IN ANY WAY.'<br>

Alice *THOUGHT*, but nothing came of it.  'Please, would you tell me what YOU call yourself?'<br>
SHE, HOWEVER ZILCH MATERIALIZED FROM IT. 'LIKE, COULD YOU DISCLOSE TO ME THAT WHICH YOU NAME YOURSELF?'<br>
