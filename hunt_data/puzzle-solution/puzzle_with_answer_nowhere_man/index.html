<h2>Solution to A Puzzle with the Answer NOWHERE MAN</h2>
<i>Authors: Aaron Bader, Kevin G. Der, and Dan Katz</i>

<p>All the across clue/answers have a letter being "transferred" from the answer
to the clue.  For example, in 1 across, the O in NICE(O)NE appears as an extra
letter in the clue c(o)at.  These letters need to be removed to enter the
clues correctly into the grid.  In addition 9 across clues have an "error" in
the transferenece, and the letter that must be removed from the grid
is <i>different</i> from the letter that must be removed from the clue.</p>  

<p>These clues are as follows:</p>
<pre>
Number   Ext. in Clue   Answer         Ext. in Ans.
5        W              GALL(E)ONS     E
12       I              (D)RAMA        D
21       L              CHAP(T)ERONE   T
26       L              DEL(H)I        H
31       A              TEN(E)TS       E
39       R              TAP(A)S        A
45       U              D(R)EADLOCKS   R
54       I              (C)INDY        C
55       N              (H)AIRBALL     H
</pre>

<p>Reading down these extra letters (clues first then answers) gives the
phrase: WILLA RUINED THE ARCH, this is another cryptic clue for CATHER with an
extra H in clue phrase: WILLA RUINED THE ARC(H).  Following the pattern from
the across clues, you also remove the H from the answer word leaving <b>CATER</b>,
the "title" to the puzzle.</p>
