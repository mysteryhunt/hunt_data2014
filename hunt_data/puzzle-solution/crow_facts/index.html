<p>The Crow Facts are all variations of quotes said by members of the Night's Watch (also known disparagingly as 'crows') in the HBO series Game of Thrones. The key is to identify the specific character that said each quote. Below are the proper quotes, the episodes in which the quotes were said, and the name of the character who said it.</p>

<p><b>Crow Fact #1: A crow gets what it earns, when it earns it.</b></p>

<p>The actual quote is "Here, a man gets what he earns, when he earns it." It is said by Benjen Stark in Season 1 Episode 3.</p>

<p><b>Crow Fact #4: There's nothing more sickening than a crow in love.</b></p>

<p>The actual quote is "There's nothing more sickening than a man in love." Eddison Tollet says this in Season 2 Episode 5.</p>

<p><b>Crow Fact #7: The crows serve crueler gods than you or I.</b></p>

<p><b>Crow Fact #9: What crows want most of all is to be a hero.</b></p>

<p>Mance Rayder says "What you want most of all is to be a hero" in Season 3 Episode 1.</p>

<p><b>Crow Fact #6: A crow won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes.</b></p>

<p>Jon Snow, in Season 1 Episode 2, says "it won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."</p>

<p><b>Crow Fact #10: Crows have their own rules, their own reasons, and you'll never know them.</b></p>

<p>Qhorin Halfhand says, "Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons, and you'll never know them" in Season 2 Episode 6.</p>

<p><b>Crow Fact #3: Now crows are here, at the end of the world, with no one to sing for but old men.</b></p>

<p>In Season 1 Episode 7, Pypar laments, "So, now I'm here, at the end of the world, with no one to sing for but old men".</p>

<p><b>Crow Fact #7: The crows here grew up in a castle, spitting down on the likes of you.</b></p>

<p>Alliser Thorne says, "Lord Snow here grew up in a castle, spitting down on the likes of you" in Season 1 Episode 3.</p>

<p><b>Crow Fact #5: Crows don't like high places.</b></p>

<p>Samwell Tarly says, "I don't like high places" in Season 1 Episode 4.</p>

<p>Aemon Targaryen says, "Sooner or later, in every man's life, there comes a day when it is not easy" in Season 1 Episode 9.</p>

<p>Each Crow Fact is also numbered. The first Crow Fact is given the number 1, but the other facts are not numbered in order, and the third and eighth facts are both labeled #7. Instead of ordering, the Crow Fact number is to be used as an index into the name of the character to give a letter:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Fact Number</th><th>Character</th><th>Extracted Letter</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Benjen Stark</td><td>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Eddison Tollet</td><td>I</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Jeor Mormont</td><td>R</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Mance Rayder</td><td>D</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Jon Snow</td><td>O</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Qhorin Halfhand</td><td>F</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Pypar</td><td>P</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Alliser Thorne</td><td>R</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Samwell Tarly</td><td>E</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Aemon Targaryen</td><td>Y</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The letters taken in the order in which the facts were received spell the answer: <b>BIRD OF PREY</b>.</p>
