<h2>Solution to Indie Audio Productions</h2>

<p><i>Author: Harrison Bralower</i></p>

<p>The solver first sees a <a href="indieaudioproductions.pdf">flyer</a> with a
bunch of supposed IAP classes on music along with MIT classroom numbers. Putting
the class names in order of classroom number and taking the first letters yields
the clue phrase PUT SHOWS IN CHRONLOGICAL ORDER, which is an instruction for the
second part of the puzzle.</p>

<p>Each classroom on the flyer has a public bulletin board near it that has a
flyer ostensibly advertising a show along with several pictures. The bands are
listed but the date and location are not. These pieces of information are clued
by the pictures on each flyer. By determining the show location (all real venues
in Boston and Cambridge) and the date clued by each flyer you can find sets of
bands actually playing at each venue on that date. The correct set of bands is
the one whose names are the same lengths as the ones on the flyer and this gives
you the year of the show. By inserting the real bands in place of the fake bands
on each flyer and then taking the outlined letters from the real band names you
get the letters needed to form a clue phrase. When the letters from the flyers,
in the order they appear on the flyers, are put in chronological order by show
date (including year) you get the clue phrase MIDEAST DOWNSTAIRS HAS ONE MORE
FLYER. If you go to the Middle East Downstairs in Central Square you find
a <a href="middleeastdownstairs.pdf">flyer</a> with thematic art on a nearby
lamppost advertising a concert headlined by a band billed as "the answer you’ve
been looking for," <b>DARK OMEN</b>.</p>

<p>The solution to each flyer is:</p>
