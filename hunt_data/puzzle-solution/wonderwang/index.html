<h2>Solution to Wonderwang</h2>

<p>Upon arrival, everyone was split into 7 groups to play 7 rounds of Wonderwang.

<p>Each round presented a word that follows a set of rules. The host of each group went around in a circle and had people say words. If their word fit the round rule, the host yelled out: "That's Wonderwang!"  This continued until everyone in the circle understood the rule and hit Wonderwang.  Then the group moved to another host for another round until all 7 rounds were completed and the rules learned.

<p>Finally, when they have finished the 7 rounds, they are presented with a sheet of paper with the final Wonderwang  which will had 40ish words. Exactly one word fit each of the 7 rounds, and pulling out those words in round order  spelled the clue phrase.

<p>The rules and the corresponding clue phrase word were as follows:

<ul>
<li>    ANY -- words ending in Y
<li>    TRIP -- words you can add S to the start of
<li>    THAT -- words that start and end with the same letter
<li>    HAS -- 3 letter words with A in the middle
<li>    NO -- words that can be spelled with the letters from WONDERWANG.
<li>    VACATIONS -- words with animals in them
<li>    BLOWS -- 5 letter words with only one vowel in the exact middle 
</ul>

<p>The phrase, therefore is: <b>ANY TRIP THAT HAS NO VACATIONS BLOWS.</b>
