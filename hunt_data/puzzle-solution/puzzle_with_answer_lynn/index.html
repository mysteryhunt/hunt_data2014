<h2>The Puzzle With The Answer LYNN</h2>
<p><i>Erin Rhode, Anand Sarwate</i></p>

<p>In this puzzle, you are presented with two columns of 26 cluephrases each.  You might notice that the first letters of the clues in the first column spell "THE ANSWER TO THE PUZZLE IS LYNN," which is great, except that you already know that, so you must actually solve the clues.  (You didn't think we'd let you off that easy, did you?)</p>

<p>The answers to all of the clues are two word phrases, which pair up (one from each column) to form 26 backswitches.  A <i>backswitch</i> is a word or phrase which becomes another when its last letter is changed (or "switched") and the remaining letters are reversed ("turned back").  So, for example, "Evaluate Aida or Carmen" in the left column is ASSESS OPERA, which forms a backswitch with REPOSSESS AM, which is the answer to the clue "Take back the morning" from the right column.</p>

<p>The final "switched" letter in all of the phrases from the left column are A-Z complete, which forms the ordering.  Taking the pairs in this order and reading the final "switched" letter of the phrases from the right column gives the clue phrase "MOTION PICTURE ABOUT CHIGGERS."  In addition, reading the first letter of the clues in the right column in this order (which were originally given alphabetically) spells "THIS TITLE IS A CABLE TV CHANNEL."  A "MOTION PICTURE ABOUT CHIGGERS" is a MITE FILM, which forms a backswitch with the cable TV channel <b>LIFETIME</b>, which is the title to this puzzle.</p>
