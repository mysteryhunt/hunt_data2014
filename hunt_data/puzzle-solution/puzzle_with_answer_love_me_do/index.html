</p>

<p>The solver is presented with a number of videos of instruments (in alphabetical order by instrument name), with 
audio from a different instrument playing "Love Me Do."  But since you 
already know that "Love Me Do" is the answer to the puzzle, this fact is
 not all that interesting.  What <i>is</i> interesting is that 
instrument playing "Love Me Do" appears in a different video.  Using 
this information you can build a chain to get an ordering, starting with
 the Bass.</p>

<p>If you follow along with the fingers (and learn quickly how to play 
these instruments), you can figure out what notes are being played and 
from there, determine what song is being played.  The songs are 
presented in alphabetical order and each video gives an enumeration 
(i.e. <i>(5, 4)</i> for the bass video) which doesn't match the title of
 the song.  However, each song was famously introduced in a movie (and 
was in fact nominated for the Oscar for Best Song) and the movie the 
song came from <i>does</i> match the enumeration.  Reading down the 
first letter of the movie titles gives the phrase SWAN BOAT CITY.  The 
city famous for swan boats, just across the river from MIT, is the 
title to the puzzle, <b>BOSTON</b>.</p>
