<p>After identifying all of the pop songs being sung by bees, one notes a few things: each song is a single released between a different year from 1964 and 1973 inclusive, giving a nice ordering; there are a different number of "bees" singing each song; an enumeration is given which does not fit the song or the artist; and finally there are <i>bees</i> singing.  The bees are singing because you are not looking for the song being sung -- you are looking for the B-side of that song.  Conveniently, the B-side fits the given enumeration.</p>

<p>Ordering by year the single was released and indexing into the B-side of the single by the number of bees singing the song gives "I GET AROUND."  <i>I Get Around</i> was an A-side single by The Beach Boys, whose B-side is the answer to the puzzle, <b>DON'T WORRY BABY</b>.</p>
