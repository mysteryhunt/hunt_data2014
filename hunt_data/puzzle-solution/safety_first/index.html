<h2>Solution to Safety First</h2>

<p>In 2013, Hunt organizers were required to distribute first aid kits to all teams for safety reasons of some sort. They were careful to stress that the first aid kit was not a puzzle.</p>

<p>At the 2014 kickoff, teams received a first aid kit, among other things. They were told, for example, that the souvenir tote bag was not a puzzle, but they were <i>not</i> told that the first aid kit is not a puzzle. Hidden inside the first aid kit was a packet of 66 cards.</p>

<p>The cards assemble into a grid 11 cards across and 6 cards down, going from lighter to darker top-to-bottom and from less saturated to more saturated left-to-right.</p>

<p>Each card has four circles on it, with a letter or number in each circle. Certain sets of six circles are connected by lines; each line enters the grid in the first card of a particular column, winds across the grid, and ends in the last card of the same column. The six numbers marked by a given line correspond to the hex code of a named color. </p>



#FFE4B5 - moccasin <br />
#7FFFD4 - aquamarine <br />
#E6E6FA - lavender <br />
#CD853F - peru <br />
#FF0000 - red <br />
#F0FFFF - azure <br />
#7FFF00 - chartreuse <br />
#D8BFD8 - thistle <br />
#4B0082 - indigo <br />
#FF7F50 - coral <br />
#50C878 - emerald <br />

<p>When the color names associated with each column are read left-to-right, the first letters of the color names spell the answer, <b>MALPRACTICE</b>.</p>
